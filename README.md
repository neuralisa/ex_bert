For this homework you will have to finish the implementation of a BERT model and train it on a dataet of rotten tomatoes reviews. The dataset is fairly large(500k) 
so I prepared a subset that is 10% of the train and test datasets. Train on the mini dataset and we will be able to compare accuracy. 

*mmlu_dataset.ipynb* contains the demonstration of how to use tiny benchmarks on a subset from MMLU to evaluate two LLMs.

assignment_bert* contans all the information necessary to complete the assignment for next week.
