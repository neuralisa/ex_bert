37746," Despite Headshot's flaws, it does have a mesmerizing quality in its illustration of humanity's dark side, social and spiritual. It's a film that coaxes into its world rather than drags.",1

107480, Sinks in its own excessive melodrama.,0
159321," For a movie about what's going on under the elaborately staged surface, it's pretty much all surface, right down to its shallow observations about gender fluidity, queer identity and the creative freedom of the alternate persona.",0

95138," A headscratcher apt to keep you guessing whether what you're watching is real or simply staged... Overall, mildly amusing, but nothing to write home about.",1
117015," It's a slice-of-life film featuring wonderful folk compositions... and Oscar Isaacs, as Llewyn, takes the starring opportunity and runs with it.",1
237911," It's both straight-faced spy film and sly spy spoof. That's a difficult balancing act, but director James Mangold exactly right.",1
63714," Well, Guy Ritchie sure put his stamp on this bit of British mythology. Lock, stock and flaming arrow.",0

243337," Both San Andreas and Rampage are directed by Brad Peyton, and they share a bland disaster-movie sameness - you get a lot of Johnson flying around in a helicopter, surveying damage, trying to warn people of impending natural disaster.",0
249455, Behind the Music this (thankfully) is not.,1
68262," an impudent, pugnacious comedy that uses the synthetic nature of its stylized homage idiom to be a whip-smart consideration of race, gender, politics, situational ethics, and very, very bad teeth",1

17024, It is truly hard to imagine more effective tinder to ignite a conversation than The Tale.,1
204442," This is frankly disposable entertainment, but to some degree it's a welcome parody of earnest superhero movies like those directed by Christopher Nolan, which for all their self-importance are fundamentally just as silly. ",0

143417," Brady's world is also one of tragedy and hardship, biological fragility taking its toll not only on Brady but those he loves, changing times curtailing his options.",1
251647, To be so obviously off-base as Fahrenheit 451 looks right now takes some doing.,0

227191," It's a buddy movie. Then again, it's political statement about corporate greed and the health-care crisis. No, it's a science-fiction tale.",0
162479," Entertaining and funny, if a little thin. David doesn't knock out Goliath.",0
42228, The straining for authenticity (as when a camera just happens to be sitting inside a car window that gets broken) becomes tiresome.,0

136702," A watchable pastiche of A Christmas Carol, this rom-com resorts to corny slapstick a bit too often but also manages to find moments of real resonance",1
84404," Babel has an undeniable power, even (or perhaps especially) when it's at its most contrived and implausible.",1
126146," The plot proves surprisingly suspenseful as, Agatha Christie-like, the culprit could be anyone.",1
147310," Don Jon is a terrific directorial debut from Gordon-Levitt - funny, moving and with something to say about family and relationships.",1
179344," [I]t's well made, but we've seen all of this, so many times before.",0
154713, It takes a special kind of biopic to reduce its subject to the least imaginably interesting version of itself.,0
43053," In a time when the film scene is flooded with sequels, remakes, spinoffs and an avalanche of superhero adventures, it is considerably miraculous that a film like ""Darkest Hour"" manages to stand out. [Full review in Spanish]",1
164594, It's all rather nebulous.,0
38120," Rebellion contains impressive cinematography and strong dialogue, and Mathieu Kassovitz shines as its director and star.",1
249630," Above all, though, it's an actors' movie. Perhaps the highest compliment one can pay them is that even the caricatures seem rich.",1
182902," Instead of being an ode to dreamers and optimists, Gilliam's latest has a mean spirited undercurrent that proves hard for the film to shake off.",0
32816," Who stole the soul of Suicide Squad? I'd say it's Ayer's willingness to go all limp-dick and compromise his hardcore action bona fides for a PG-13 crowdpleaser that would rather ingratiate than cut deep, or even cut at all. ",0
37438, The story of a gruelling trek through sub-zero temperatures that is both visually stunning and dramatically chilly.,1
50076," The humans are a bore, but the vampires light up this Night.",1
67595," This movie is single-handedly causing a major rise in our mirth deficit. It's so bad, I'm declaring a laugh emergency.",0
66563, Burton and company were harkening back to the old days-the Hammer/AIP pictures from the fifties and sixties. And they hit that nail right on the fricking head.,1
79773," This movie is about Bill Maher's opinion of religion. He's very smart, quick and funny, and I found the movie entertaining, although sometimes he's a little mean to his targets.",1
218495, The old country comes to the New World in a magical tale with ancient roots of a prodigal son returning for revenge . . .like a cinematic DeToqueville. . . kooky and lovely.,1
52076," Unlike with [Beckett's] Happy Days, or Un Chien Andalou, or the films of Michael Haneke before it, Sleeping Beauty has not left me pondering its puzzle passionately enough. The film is pretty, but ultimately impenetrable to a fault.",0

59443," Further proof that of all the genres he dabbles in, samurai cinema is the one that brings out the grandest entertainer in Miike. Here's to 100 more.",1
153910, This rather picaresque tale of an Indian family opening a restaurant in rural France never really indulges our senses.,0

221689," Slither goes for the predictable gags, usually mocking the stereotypical redneck characters or spoofing stock horror moments. ",0
198764, The motive just isn't gripping enough.,0
13955," Taking an open ended TV pilot rejected by the networks, [Lynch] added 45 minutes and created closure in a weird, mystical logic that, in its unique Lynchian way, makes a twisted emotional sense.",1

161241," If your kid has never seen a 3D movie, this isn't a bad start, especially if they're younger. The look is great, but the movie is just bland.",0
220823," It's a decent pop spectacle: big songs, adorable backstage horseplay, and some genuinely surprising demonstrations of talent.",1
215089," To witness the sequence broken down in forensic detail is to appreciate its economy of storytelling anew, and to see its influence on subsequent popular culture, but to do so for 90 minutes might stretch even a superfan's patience.",0
126720," It's a great dynamic and it works but my favorite character isn the whole thing was Alan Tudyck as King Candy, such a hilarious throwback to the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland.",1
170423, Rivetingly haunting.,1
77915, Adolescence was never supposed to be this wholesome.,0
226388," A well-intentioned routinary comedy, and let's face it, very charming. [Full review in Spanish]",1
249737," War is so complex that there's no way to see through to any single, objective explanation",1
226479," The film is admirable for its gentle hand when it comes to difficult subjects like the ephemeral nature of life, and its bold visual style, but it's also a film whose final reel seems unwilling to recognize the realities of its own story.",1
48259," Go ahead, dance it out.",1
114004, The film belongs to its two stars.,1
13396," The climax is lovely, Psotta is a beautifully persuasive, serious young heroine and the dogs are magnificent. ",1
146047, Worth checking out.,1
154780, A decent feel-good flick that features also decent music. The real reason to see it is the acting especially that of Mark Ruffalo who gives a career best performance. ,1
170195, I wish I hadn't seen it.,0
91140," A mess with no clear idea, not quite salvaged by some very charasmatic actors.",0
82671," [It] features a number of laugh out loud moments. The humor is fairly versatile, featuring bodily humor for the kids and some small meta-moments for the adults.",1
162737," This is, for the most part, a well-made piece of summer entertainment. It just clobbers the viewer senseless with action.",1

229491," Timothy Spall mesmerises, proving the artist is beautiful and monstrous.",1
235270," The early '90s were also not exactly a robust period in political cinema, and the influence of the Moral Majority - so clearly felt in Atwood's text - wasn't as pronounced in the Bush I White House as it had been in Reagan's. But, sadly, it sure is now. ",1
27645," A completely bizarre sex farce that's heartfelt and stomach-turning in about equal measure, Choke also delivers a terrific climactic twist and the best dumb- blonde joke in years.",1
41121," Martin Sherman's script presents a genuinely fascinating slice of history, enlivened with some catchy songs, some imaginatively staged dance numbers and, oh yes, lots of naked flesh.",1
249317," Ultimately, like much of the DCEU, Aquaman just can't make things work. While there's a definite sense of humor behind the film, it doesn't take things far enough.",0

193128, Jack Black used to be so cool.,0
89183," There's a lot less going on in The Intern - the story of an old guy who goes to work for one of those fancy new e-commerce places, whatever that is - than meets the eye, or the funny bone. ",0
144917," God bless Steven Spielberg, who knows how to push my buttons.",1
32819," It's watchable in spite of itself, and Gyllenhaal and Monaghan are great together. But it's not nearly as clever as it thinks it is -- especially in its final minutes.",1

167643," ""I Am Number Four"" is like a good episode of ""Smallville"": You may feel a bit silly watching it if you're past high-school age, but you just might have a good time.",1
63650," While Happy Death Day starts well enough and is very proud of its sense of humour, it's too lazy to bother its arse when the time comes to justify its premise.",0
136896, A dreary Ghostbusters reboot of the Ivan Reitman classic from 1984.,0
65575," Leduc is an author worth knowing about, but this is a character only an already-established fan could love.",0
124483, ... a truly sumptuous opera--one of cinema's best efforts.,1
80114," Though fact-based movies are often guilty of bending truth to improve a story, Finding Steve McQueen goes in the other direction, downplaying strange-but-true elements that might have helped its saggy narrative.",0
250592," As you'd expect, Meyers handles the material with assurance and charm, and there's fun to be had in the odd-couple dynamic at her film's heart.",1
160655," Molly's Game is a prime showcase for one of Hollywood's most versatile actresses, but the film as a whole doesn't live up to Chastain's fiery performance. A lot is said, but very little sticks with you after the end credits roll.",0

214488, Aimed at viewers young enough still to need day care.,0
189397," Cuaron is an auteur in his own right, and as such puts his stamp on his own life's story. But in doing so, he never picks the stamp up, too often letting shots linger far longer than they are interesting.",0
82724," [Has] a heavier and more distinct feel that most caper films, but like a lot of recent movies, it tries to disguise its thin story with uselessly convoluted plotting.",1
87807, I never thought a movie with this pedigree would remind me of 'Dawson's Creek.',0
85109, The film is perhaps too even-handedly in love with the sisterhood it portrays.,0
134841," The original Sinister was a passable chiller, but the sequel feels more like a vague attempt to continue a lucrative franchise than to create anything truly compelling or spooky. ",0
50671," Alex Cross is coarse, punishing, and, in all the ways that matter, conscienceless ...",0

237985, so faithful it borders on bland,0
211543, Mila Kunis is one of the most underrated actresses today. She's so funny. ,1

58094," Modestly budgeted but professional, this film has some imaginative visuals and a strong cast.",1
135112," It doesn't help that Kunis and McKinnon share zero chemistry, thus sucking the air out of each scene in which they're supposed to be bonding.",0
34823," It's a spirited rom-com with 3 strong leads who can do any number of brilliant comedic turns in their sleep. Or in their kitchens. Or in an assortment of beds, where the fun truly heats up.",1
229968," Heroic, well done, a must-see",1
184643, Considerably less grounded in any kind of recognizable reality than the first chapter.,0
41854," A fascinating, thought-provoking film.",1
61366, There are a lot of great ideas struggling to find their way out of this misshapen hulk of a film.,0
34472, The film is also grimly compelling on a dramatic level as an account of a family struggling desperately for survival.,1
158365, A notable cast - and noble intentions - can't elevate what is a very ordinary film.,0
117188," Brandon Routh strikes memorable iconic poses, but his Man of Steel lacks personality. ... Similarly, Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane is D.O.A.",0
212140," It could have been funnier and some of the sheep penis jokes could have been circumcised, but there is an appealing cumulative effect to the nonsense",1
129929," Streep may be a hot Oscar favourite but you need more than a star turn to make a good movie, and The Iron Lady isn't likely to please anyone in Britain.",0
139843, Bartkowiak's latest interchangeable pieces of wood (with range nearly as impressive) are Jet Li and DMX.,0
131249," The balance between true-crime cable soap and the darker, richer layers of Franco's performance never quite adds up.",0

99872," A two-hour marathon of deceit, murder and mayhem with absolutely no point or interest.",0
93043," Blitz is lost here, flailing with terrible scenes, trying to make something meaningful stick with stillborn material and a dead-eyed cast. ",0
40598," The Wrestler shows that, in both movies and wrestling, the line between reality and play-acting may be less clear than we assume.",1
91166," Director Crystal Moselle stands back from her subjects, allowing them to do most of the talking. Her camera is remarkably non-judgmental, especially given how easily it could have become a ""look at the freak show"" sort of film.",1

248980," ...what happens? Well, not much, actually.",0
107515," ... achieves a modest tension through its unsettling atmosphere, although there's a general predictability to the story that undermines the mystery and can't be erased by a few jolting twists.",0

238375, The surreal comedy is that every tense twist of this secret war is horribly true.,1
194134, Morning Glory is just routine Hollywood dishonesty (with the most annoying song-score since Juno) and wastes its stars.,0
98467, Ought to have been an agreeable place to spend an hour-and-a-half. Instead after ninety minutes you'll find yourself wishing you'd checked out early.,0
85669," It serves as both a talent-squandering prequel and sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman, while doing nothing more than name-check Snow White.",0
213414," Much like his previous films as a director, Jenkins' Beale Street adaptation is a richly layered and beautifully atmospheric work of cinematic poetry.",1
57447," Quite the opposite of the great earlier film, the Oz here is a dull place to be. Given the choice, you might even consider going back to Kansas.",0
41082, We just haven't had too many films that concentrate on this story.,1
123150, Denzel's noble vigilante couldn't be a more absurd fantasy figure if he were clad in a comic-book superhero's cape and tights. ,0

90445," At times, this unconventional Western verges on becoming one of the angriest feminist statements in recent memory.",1
37353," Rom-com fanatics and Austen aficionados may find gems in Austenland, but others will see this as a film with little sense or sensibility.",0
228692," A smart reinvention of a classic story. Go see this one with your family, your friends or on a date. [Full review in Spanish]",1
12927," While the music keeps things in step with the dancing, the rest of the you've-seen-it-before story has trouble keeping up.",0

59669, every person in the audience can see some portion of the film and remember being faced with similar obstacles in their lives.,1
41199, A robot with consciousness gets lost in a junkyard of a movie,0
49378," While the movie might not be as artistic as, say, one from Disney-Pixar, it features better combat scenes than much of its live-action brethren -- including the recent Forbidden Kingdom.",1
37078," Chinese-Canadian helmer-scribe Johnny Ma makes a remarkably mature debut, exposing with stunning clarity the infuriating red tape and flawed logic of China's system regarding criminal responsibility and insurance policies.",1
221260, A fitting final act for noir master Jean-Pierre Melville ...,1
49195," There will be lots of versions of Theron's evil queen running around West Hollywood this Halloween; it's a performance that's one part Tilda Swinton to 30 parts Faye Dunaway, the sort of over-the-top craziness that spawns midnight screenings.",0
124304," The least ambitious Pixar story, but the animation is prodigious. [Full review in Spanish] ",1
45198," Tough and taciturn, Craig has re-energized the franchise after the shaky Brosnan years, definitely demonstrating that the series has once again earned its license to thrill.",1
240746, Even the undeniable heroism of the passengers on United 93 doesn't edify as it should.,0
22276," No film this year burrowed deeper into my consciousness this year than ANNIHILATION. Top that truly mindbender of a plot with excellent acting, beautiful visuals, and an awesome score and you have film at the height of its power.",1
177436," Lame horror entry about a woman who gives birth to a literal little monster won't scare up the bucks, in spite of post-fest hype.",0
67341," When a film piles on this many problems for its characters, it's often because it doesn't really believe in any of them.",0

230655," Whoever designed Knightly's ""armor"" has to be given a pat on the back by all of us who find her an object of sauciness and desire.",1
97267," A tough little crime drama full of muted anger, growled dialogue and whispered threats...Much as we applaud the achievements of filmmakers working on small budgets, you can't hand out free passes when those limitations hobble the flow and feel of a film.",1
23817, It's the haunted house that cliché built.,0
27406, Director Julian Schnabel and screenwriter Ronald Harwood have performed a small miracle in adapting for the screen Jean-Dominique Bauby's autobiography The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.,1

119982, Loving has Jeff Nichols' trademarks but it lacks the nuanced storytelling that made his previous films so successful.,1

181932, The Past is a beautifully acted and cleverly constructed drama.,1
132119," Stronger's inability to fuss over the details, of succumbing to saccharine generalities rather than sincere specifics, leaves you with a film that operates on the most banal of sentiments.",0

29531," The comic possibilities of a character mistakenly ingesting a tab of acid and then acting predictably loony at the most inopportune moment are surely limitless, or at least it must have seemed so to the makers of Death of a Funeral. ",0
138556," Who says critics are useless? Now you don't have to see the movie, unless, of course, you derive some satisfaction/pleasure from graphic violence, unforgivably cliched scripts and/or repeated sightings of Gooding's bare bottom.",0
241584," Ben Is Back is watchable enough, thanks mostly to the performances of Roberts and Hedges, but it feels like a missed opportunity to explore a real and terrible zombie apocalypse, one that most Americans might recognize as a plausible horror.",1
241157," If you have ever entertained the possibility of swimming against the current of your own time stream and remaking key choices therein, then you've likely put more thought into this premise than Curtis did. ",0
146764," A trio of noteworthy performances from Watts, Del Toro, and Penn is countered by lengthy, drawn-out, non-linear storytelling that guts the film's dramatic impact.",0
59375," Unstintingly explores and exposes excruciating pain, raw grief, ruinous vengeance and life-affirming resilience, creating human portraits that are uncommonly exhilarating in their honesty.",1
111384," Imagine the elaborate plan: 'We use the sets left over from Red Riding Hood, add a candy house, throw in some aerial forest shots out of Twilight, keep it cheap. Steampunk it up, and have 'em wear leather, 'specially her. Lotsa cleavage.'",0

136011, No one strikes the right balance of tongue-in-cheeky spoof and go-for-broke cliffhanger.,0
127495," It's obvious in hindsight why Penn and Teller would be so drawn to this ethereally beautiful mystery: Their passion for all things seemingly magical, often mechanical, and always amazing is practically their trademark.",1
65664," The essence of ""Ant-Man"" is inherently silly, and that's where the strength of the new movie lies. ",1

3560," It's a breathtaking work, and a key citation in the case for confession as suitable material for art.",1

230441, A privileged peek into a little pocket of something close to a functioning democratic system.,1

251529," Easily the worst movie of the week, month, year, and Bullock's entire career. It is to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.",0

70885," Despite its dated sensibilities, and Branagh's awkward updates, Murder on the Orient Express remains a lulling, cushiony pleasure.",1
17594, Night is brisk but surprisingly comprehensive. It also further burnishes Hitchcock's reputation and gives Bernstein his long overdue acknowledgment.,1

123872," Unfortunately dopey, it's a nonsensical, mind-numbing disappointment.",0
112399," That rare film that tries to do too much, yet carries the heavy load of its themes with ease. Audiard dreams big, and his movie is unquestionably a classic crime film, because it transcends all of the conventions of the genre.",1
138373, Horrible torture. David O. Russell hates us. ,0
132670," This is 40 is crude and dull, with a supporting cast that reminds you how utterly uninteresting the main characters are.",0
85039," an effective emotional rollercoaster that explores the dark side of human nature, and its concise, pessimistic view of the American Dream is still admired today.",1
64582," One doesn't come to a movie of this sort expecting anybody's best work. Or at least one certainly shouldn't, because it won't materialize.",0
215325, Freddy Krueger's reinvention is a humor-free remake that flags until the satisfying final scenes.,0
199366, Black comedy is one thing (and I like it well done) but this is far from that. Sometimes shootings are intended to raise a laugh and sometimes the killings are in deadly earnest.,0
250368," M:I-2 ain't bad, but it sure isn't as great as it could have been.",0
43757," The picture lacks the thrills and dramatic charge of kidnap-thriller Taken, with Neeson here befuddled rather than angry, but his gravitas and conviction elevate the material.",1
100864, It seems that Lee and Schamus had no idea what it was they wanted to say here. Did Woodstock matter? Does anyone care?,0
50242, ...it fails most crucially in pulling its strings together in a way that's not nearly as impressive as it's straining to be.,0
91508, When We First Met earns points for knowing when to stick to the rom-com guidelines while still inserting a good amount of comedy into a shaky premise. ,1
7429," Dungeons and Dragons-style fantasy, with its species-specific stats and attributes, is a pretty suspect well to draw from if you're trying to pull off some kind of modern-day race relations metaphor.",0
145393," Shyamalan takes the beloved Nickelodeon anime series and turns it into 103 minutes of overproduced, stilted nonsense.",0
197165," The producers stuck to the logical approach of breaking down nominees by genre... That said, the presenter banter was often painful, making a case for trotting out fewer celebrities and then actually giving them time to do or say something.",0
28572," Mr. Grohl has put a lot of affection into this film, and it shows.",1
180595," Fun, action, nonsense, classic rock, and over-the-top situations abound. Popcorn is optional.",1
109473, Unrelenting realism ends up tarnishing the film's moral righteousness by making its important but predictable provocations seem unnecessarily and unrewardingly direct.,0
203577," With the precision of a cinematic diamond cutter, filmmaker Barry Jenkins has crafted a great three-chapter chronicle...",1
69663," ""The Peanuts Movie"" introduces the Peanuts gang to a whole new generation by bringing them to life with all of their foibles and neuroses attached.",1

234053," It's all kind of cute. Maybe a little too cute, but it does have a nice circle-of-life ending.",1
110797," Mostly, Arrietty is simply gorgeous, embracing the ravishing colour of garden flowers, wildly sprouting vines, the perfection of a raindrop on a leaf.",1
64593," The film gets at a universal truth: everyone knows how to deal with their own crazy family, but dealing with the crazy family of your significant other takes some real adjustment. ",1
227296," Perfume is ultimately an unmistakable failure, but there's a strange majesty to its epic overreaching.",0
122367," For the many generations that grew up with Rogers' friendly face as their guide, Won't You Be My Neighbor is like peering into the past with renewed clarity and wishing his civility had caught on. ",1
166714," If Levinson were trying to capture the sentiment of his earlier film Good Morning, Vietnam, which successfully mixed comedy and war, Rock the Kasbah completely misses the mark.",0
15000," For those seeking a wickedly dark little confection, Thoroughbreds should prove a diverting watch; but those looking for anything deeper will find a lot left to be desired.",1
113839," Wild Things isn't overlong, but it is underwhelming.",0
71369, BlacKkKlansman is as entertaining as it is provocative. It's not a polemic. It's a fully-realized film.,1
131270, 'Sabotage' violates a cardinal rule everyone understood in the 1980s: if you are going to have a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger don't surround him with actors that are better than he is.,0
228665," An impeccable work that moves forward steadily and without much dynamic modulation, it's a movie not for people who want to escape the world but for those who want to understand it better.",1
30170," No Country for Old Men is wide and dusty and terribly bleak. It's beautifully photographed and assembled, with great performances from its lead players and a number of welcome appearances by actors we haven't seen enough of lately.",1
207683," What is, I suspect, intended as an awakening of something untamed and unconstrained in Ania comes across instead as the unleashing of a disturbing cruelty... not a triumph of feminist discovery.",0
71346, Non-Stop isn't a bad example of its type of film; merely an unexceptional one.,0

222898," Several good actors turn up to no particular effect -- including Ray Winstone as Finn's surly mentor, and Donald Sutherland as a mega-yacht-owning billionaire.",0
36567," It has a charming protagonist in Will Shortz, the crossword editor of the New York Times.",1
27164," We're used to documentaries having a pedagogical or activist itinerary, but Wiseman's have become fastidiously unpedantic -- his simple Terence-like interest in what other human beings do and how they do it is more than enough.",1
37790," Boring, trite, sexist tripe that wants to make the viewer empathize with a guy who's actually pretty aggressive in his pursuit of loserdom.",0
121060, A spectacular train wreck of a film where the participants seem oblivious to the dreck they've crafted and performed in.,0
170124," The ending, plain and simple, cheapens all that has come before.",0
55339," Brie is always a delight, but SLEEPING WITH OTHER PEOPLE is a fairly bland rom-com that too often brings to mind the superior WHEN HARRY MET SALLY. ",0
212255, Few movies this year have been as all-out fun to watch as this one.,1
130488," It's classic Branagh: sweeping landscapes, thundering score, capital-A Acting, and, excitingly - at least for format nerds like me - it's shot on 65mm film.",1
112381," The movie only forgets some actual comedy and to make the assorted heroes likeable. Other than that, it's still pretty bad.",0
238671," You need not don a red, yellow, and green T-shirt to appreciate the film. ",1
92824," The only truly scary thing in The Cave is the idea, as set up by the ending, that there could be a sequel.",0
71071," A rich, engaging portrait not only of Africa's great filmmaker, but also of the course (and necessity) of influence, including co-filmmaker Gadjigo's journey while discovering more about the life and work of his late friend.",1
97529," A lavish reminder of how fiercely proud China is of its past, and of how much more of it we'll get to see in the coming years.",1
133508, I've seen glaciers with a faster pace and better focused on its intrigue.,0
134166," So long, Freddy, it's been good to know you.",1
122483," Children of Men is worth seeing, if for no other reason than the gorgeous vision of the end of the world Cuarón has crafted and, as mentioned earlier, some of the most unreal single-take action sequences ever committed to screen.",1
52303," For all of the foreboding visuals, once we work on what's happening, we're less afraid than impatient.",1
184895, Revenge is smartly made.,1
126513," In A Scanner Darkly, we're watching other people freak out, but the film is maddening to sit through because their freak-outs never become ours.",0
175379," A brilliant and incredible look at the actor's experience, and a world that's lost its ability to distinguish between famous and talented.",1
24515, The film transcends the déjà vu of its borrowed trappings but ironically sacrifices all momentum in favor of a long series of physical tests.,0
67401," Cruel Intentions is smarter and funnier than anything in the recent cycle of high-school sex comedies... but it's little more than a wildly uneven, sporadically enjoyable guilty pleasure.",1
39969," As this doc shows, he went as low as he could possibly go, until his repugnant behaviour finally caught up with him - as it must to all such men.",1
180692, a consistently inconsistent drama that could and should have been so much better.,1
69947," 300 is one breathtaking digi-tableau after another. But the dialogue is a joke, the performances have more to do with bodybuilding than character, and the lesson that the film imparts isn't anything to do with courage and military skill.",0
240505," Really, did we need Kaufman to point out how boneheaded Hollywood can be? And does he do all that much better when, ultimately, he looks to mainstream conventions for the means to put the finishing touches on his tale?",1
193449," The English Patient's heart may be in the right place, but the fire is lacking.",0
248516, The film sanguinely captures the razor's edge of planetary fame as well as the long-term consequences of childhood trauma. It's a must-see for anyone with even a passing interest in the Whitney Houston story.,1
62614," This tiny film is heartfelt, well made and worthy of attention.",1
96880," Transformers delivers on its promise of stunning visuals and well-crafted action sequences, but it's not remotely worth the slog it takes to get there. Once the novelty of the robots wears off it's hopelessly insipid.",0
156292, I'm starting to believe Weerasethakul is pranking us all. [Full review in Portuguese.],0
20206, It's a slow-motion horror movie founded on utter nonsense.,0
104481, A handsome film made with real flair.,1
250429," The film never quite convinces as anything other than a puff-piece for Keaton, but it is bolstered by another deeply empathetic turn from Macdonald.",0
198028," If the summer film season is a monthslong shindig, then Life of the Party is the turd in the punchbowl.",0
126143," He's back and still nasty. Does not disappoint, even better than the first.",1
99923, The most anticipated release of the year is not much more than a spanking great bore.,0
128524," Nymphomaniac's first volume is grounded in humanity, while the second revels in its absence.",1
220364," Wrath of the Titans is proof that while ugly pictures make a bad film worse, prettier ones don't make a bad film better.",0
186212," Southside With You showcases a city as photogenic, dynamic, and charming as the lovers themselves.",1
55949," The market has been saturated with vampires in recent years, but fortunately Dracula Untold - an origins story that will hopefully lead to future outings - doesn't feel stale.",1
122876," While it occasionally drags a bit, the film captures the same tone -- knowing without being overtly jokey -- that made Tremors so entertaining.",1
230067," The movie ends up like Davy Jones himself -- many-tentacled, full of bluster, and devoid of a beating heart.",0
236537," For all its hipster posturing, fast cutting, and camera tricks, this tale of chicanery is peculiarly arid and brittle, without a single character worth caring about.",0
176765," If you've got a friend who isn't into horror movies, this isn't the one that'll change his or her mind, but for someone who's undeniably drawn to the campy slasher sub-genre, this fairly straightforward thrill ride is a good time.",1
29753," The Kingdom may be the most potent counter-programming of the year, even though it has no patience with such sissy-pants concerns.",1
225200," Betelgeuse doesn't fully emerge until the film is half over, but Michael Keaton makes a strong enough impression in the role to explain why the picture is named after his character. ",1
65559," Audiences new to Edgar Allan Poe's work will comes away from McTeigue's trite thriller with little understanding of the man himself, the times he lived him, or his hugely influential canon.",0
25206," It pains me to say it, but as far as I can see it's an extended and slightly better crafted example of those fake 'reality TV' shows.",0
145546, The film is neither as serious nor as entertaining as it was trying to be. The road in CAMINO is one well-traveled. ,0
55938," An earnest, handsomely shot and often effective, if overly schematic, drama in the service of a political message.",1
165573," Any fondness you might have for it is all but guaranteed to evaporate at the end, when after reaching its preordained conclusion it spends a full 20 minutes wallowing in unnecessary mawkishness. ",0
250791, The popular Disney Channel series moves to the big screen for a full-fledged movie musical.,1
97341," The women in [Widows]have depth. They shift and transform, ... [they] aren't singularly labeled or monolithic.",1
13753, It's a compelling story with wonderfully drawn characters and a world that carries weight.,1
212473," ...a love letter to Reynolds that manages to adore him unsentimentally, understanding that revealing the flaws can result in a fuller, richer portrait",1
192534, The result's highly effective on a human level. If only the film had been set in the real world. ,1
158968," It's fun for fans of west coast hip-hop but suffocates any hope of depth; what, for example, about the group's lyrical misogyny and homophobia?",1
42677," ...a little bit whimsical, a little bit scary, and a whole lot of charming.",1
84584, The film flows well and leaves a pleasant sensation despite the fact that it treads over predictable storylines. [Full Review in Spanish],1
104779, an animated fluffball-a sort of Toy Story with pets- does everything to drive you crazy and ends up by being totally irresistible. ,1
249189," Cronenberg doesn't pull any punches in his excoriation of this world, but he doesn't provide much revelatory insight either.",0
165364," Rather than sifting through the emotional layers of a surprisingly determined young woman, more often the scenes feel drained of life.",0
11033," It's unfortunate, then, that this earnest, hard-working adaptation of the 2006 Michelle Wildgen novel... isn't a more satisfying dramatic portrayal of the disease and its impact.",0
240720," A perfectly functional horror reboot that far surpasses usual dire sequels, prequels and reimaginings that litter the cinema landscape.",1
23355, As flaccid and undistinguished as star James LeGros's period wig.,0
210316, When will someone realize that sexy Sarah Jessica Parker is pure comic gold and start writing movies that give her a chance to glisten? She's the only spice in this too-sweet romantic comedy.,0
172838, [It] seems reluctant to use the potentials for astute comic strip philosophy that all the other films revelled in to a greater or lesser extent.,0
185197," One of the few pictures to take religious belief seriously without getting maudlin or sanctimonious about it...Stark and unsentimental, it's a quietly powerful piece that encourages reflection rather than tears.",1
11443, Simultaneously nasty and painfully dull.,0
33639," At about nine minutes Police, Adjective might have been tolerable. At just shy of two hours it's a slog that would have Bela Tarr tearing out his hair.",0
136530," Perhaps by counting the stars, audiences won't count the number of times they actually laugh during ""Entourage"" - though that number is far smaller.",0
141362," Even Clooney seems to be spinning his wheels here, playing the same self-aware looniness we've seen from him in Coen Brothers movies, just as Jeff Bridges is right back in ""Big Lebowski"" territory.",0
221240," It's sporadically amusing to watch Caine, Freeman and Arkin do their thing, however little is asked of them. But that's not enough; one keeps imagining what they could have made of stronger, more challenging material.",0
174101," Die Another Day is both skillful and playful, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give a 007 film.",1
174831, Is being smart hip again?,1
189280," simply one of the finest documentaries I have ever seen ... This is an important, vital piece of filmmaking, and one that takes the artform to a new and altogether fascinating place.",1
107872," Wim Wenders' tribute to (and for) the legendary choreographer Pina Bausch (who I have met several times) captures vividly the artist and her work, while putting to great use the 3D technology.",1
31255," Love makes the magic in Woody Allen's latest movie, and it helps to have such likable stars as Colin Firth and Emma Stone in the leading roles.",1
13779, A surprisingly effective dog's tale.,1
91120," Danny Boyle's trippy, Inception-like thriller is a hypnotic head trip that demands you trust no one. ",1
185728," Sure, it's a bit ponderous and obvious. It curiously avoids giving Yellow Hawk and his people human traits. But I'm not sure it doesn't give audiences hungry for a Western exactly what they think they want. ",1
27693," Even if it didn't have a spellbinding central performance from Cate Blanchett, Carol would be worth seeing just for its sumptuous re-creation of an era...Todd Haynes' film is luminescent - like a perfectly preserved Kodachrome image.",1
6155," Shelton is too much in thrall to improvisation, and letting the actors ""find"" their characters.",0
97737, The main issue is that we're not given enough context to understand the characters' motivations or care much about their eventual fates.,0
34780," As the film progresses ... the inanity of the proceedings begins to take over the comedy, and no amount of performance magic can rescue the conclusion, enjoyably madcap as it may be.",0
95478," Joy doesn't resonate as a hard-hitting, memorable biography, but as a lightweight, ultimately charming slice of entrepreneurial spirit, it works.",1
29619," Beauty, strength, goodness, bravery: These are your values, and here is how your values must look.",0
220747," Pulpy, good fun... a mostly entertaining and welcome return to the [gangster] genre.",1
146860, just a great sweet movie,1

15544, The only thing you can't get angry at are the adorable animal actors.,0
7141," If ever a movie was guilty of overkill it is this one. The excesses overwhelm the senses and make the biggest ""sin"" a lack of entertainment.",0

212478, Clift's man-in-crisis performance is one of his finest.,1
98092, Please don't give this movie your money.,0

51326," The result makes it possible to watch the unwatchable. And for this alone, Son of Saul is a rare accomplishment.",1
61896," Little happens -- save for several family arguments and the artist worrying about money and the integrity of his ambition -- yet it is unforgettable, and, shot to look like a moving Vermeer painting, effortlessly profound.",1
13535," Morris clearly invested so much time and energy in McKinney's story because he saw her as emblematic of our crazed times. Others might wonder whether the sad saga deserves quite this much attention, but there's no denying the film's morbid fascination.",1
53935, It's a romantic comedy on the verge of a nervous breakdown.,1
38427," This time, the Force wasn't with him.",0
247654," It's the kind of movie you don't necessarily flip past when it shows up on HBO, but that doesn't mean it's good.",0
32341," There are late-summer films that impress with how far beyond their B-movie calling they dare to go; Kidnap does exactly the job it came to do and clocks out, not particularly caring whether or not you remember it in an hour.",0
94601," Monster's Ball tries to put a new spin on the salt and pepper romance plot. The result: a convoluted, overwrought interracial drama that oversells its message",0
170511," The original at least had a pretty cool maze, unfortunately now they have taken it because apocalyptic zombie scenarios sell more. Yawn",0
248111, Neither its elaborate doomsday F/X or overstuffed cast can replicate the sheer star power and infectious by-the-numbers plotting of the boneheaded original film.,0
203412," ... a shaggy-dog version of a Jack London story, enhanced with an animatronic leopard seal that looks like Charlie the Tuna.",0
50736, It is still a work of considerable merit.,1
15163, Joe Wright's Pan is an incredibly derivative new take on a classic character -- but it's not all bad.,0
70131," ""Everything, Everything"" doesn't even set up a bar for Maddy and Olly to overcome, instead insisting on the idea that we should just make believe like mindless children.",0

244203," There are definitely moments of poetry and sweetness, and it is a notable achievement, years in the making.",1
10049," Purgatorio is maybe closer to it - something bad is happening, not the full Inferno, but it could be the gateway to the Paradiso of this fantastically boring film actually coming to an end.",0
12189, A film that brings little insight to a troubling issue.,0
246668," Thoroughbred is light on story, and could probably use a little padding out... but it nonetheless impresses with its mordant humor and grim, gliding style.",1
12479," Much of the film comes across as a well-crafted, Altman-esque attempt to present a kaleidoscopic view of complex and thorny issues.",1
46405," By the time Zombieland reached its climax, I actually cared about who lived and died, and that reaction honestly took me by surprise.",1
69750," Elf isn't Christmas cheer, it's Christmas excrement, and here's hoping it finds its way to the sewers as fast as possible.",0
102435," With all this talk of gold propelling the action, it's Reilly who has the Midas touch.",1
95173, The two things that keep the film from falling into laughable melodrama are its continual inventions on a stylistic level ... and the exceptional level of acting.,1
159229, A pretty crazy film that ends up being a failed mix of ideas that never know how to deal with all of its excesses. [Full review in Spanish],0
80361, It will do what it sets out to do -- to entertain younger kids without driving their parents nuts -- but the bar isn't set very high here.,0
191466," Writer/director Tarik Saleh constructs this tale of a compromised murder investigation in the minefield of institutional corruption, and it is both hilarious and disturbing. ",1
62001, There's an ethereal dramatic effect here that transcends a primary function of imagination and storytelling. ,1

39052," Once you get into the rhythms of the film, you'll discover a masterpiece.",1
83861," American Ninja 4 has remarkably little to offer barring a horribly executed, but somehow still ballsy, Road Warrior homage and a fumbled team up between two charisma-vacant leads",0
108958," A complex, compelling brew, enhanced throughout by Egoyan's hypnotic style. Sadly, it's also weirdly remote and agonisingly slow.",1
87252," Director Stephen Chbosky, who previously adapted The Perks of Being a Wallflower (his own novel) for the screen has fashioned a irresistibly warm, unabashedly humanist family picture.",1
499," A glowing fantasy that approaches perfection in its unlabored comic style, and the way it subtly develops dark themes of creativity and control. ",1
44140," The film is littered with some genuinely tense and exciting action sequences, with Branagh proving he can direct the complex fight scenes as well as he can the monologues.",1
128720," The murky ethics behind the making of Risk fit the murkier ethics of its subject, meaning this is one of those ""accidentally good"" movies that is a trainwreck for all involved, but might still be worth watching.",0
226060, To see these ideas delivered so profoundly speaks volumes to the power animation possesses in cleansing minds weathered by the cynicism of adulthood.,1
131790," Warm Bodies is an ingenious hybrid that, at its best, manages to be funny, lyrical and gruesome.",1
245045," A tasteful, surprisingly sedate biopic slathered in the traditional signposts of heavy exposition, gold-toned cinematography, and note-perfect period detail.",1
15125," 'What planet is this?' asked Adrien. 'Wherever it is, my iPhone 4 keeps dropping calls,' said Danny Trejo.",0
208926," Although slow moving most of the time, this unusual movie gives viewers some profound subjects to think about . ",1
72446," The plot of this Alien prequel was a carefully guarded secret -- so carefully guarded, in fact, that not even the movie reveals it.",0
131687," ""Bird"" is a bracing shot across the bow of both the sports and movie industries. And one senses that Soderbergh, 30 years into his career, is just getting started.",1
59934," For a film that shows nothing but utter contempt for the stories it was born of, it is strange at how much the filmmakers require the viewer to be well versed in the history",0

210385," If this is satire, By the Time It Gets Dark is a mostly toothless one.",0
245339," There are a few rough edges on this gritty drama, but a stellar performance by Randeep Hooda smoothens any jaggedness",1
250379," There's no edge in Ledger's performance, only a lot of cutesy moments.",0
201022," André Téchiné's The Witnesses (Les Témoins) treats the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, first in the United States and then spreading to the rest of the world in 1984, as a devastating medical atrocity in a war that is still raging.",1
201872," Slack direction from Walt Becker (National Lampoon's Van Wilder) sullies this formula comedy, but the cast is agreeable, particularly Marisa Tomei as the diner owner who falls for the constipated Macy.",1
164382," A spicy hot tortilla full of laughs, romance and one hell of a stunning leading lady...this year's ""Risky Business""...entertains thoroughly",1
218699," Little more than a slapdash woman's wish-fulfillment fantasy--in which male entertainers bare their all for their pleasure--that embodies a man's wish-fulfillment one, in which their jiggling and shaking sets women a-flutter.",0
142313," While his visual take on the life of J.M.W. Turner's is among Leigh's most ambitious attempts, outside of a few key scenes and good performances, the film lays lifeless like a PBS special on a Sunday afternoon.",0

177448," Lots of gags fly by, many of them in questionable taste (some downright offensive) and most of them unfunny.",0
97521," The pic's attempts at comic portraiture feel sketchy at best, more or less assigning each character a single, belabored trait.",0
184521," Insultingly the filmmakers thought that modern audiences want lots of nudity and lots of gore, but would not appreciate decent writing or interesting characters.",0
216696," Unimaginable horrors apparently weren't enough for the makers of ""The Promise""; they also felt compelled to throw in a love triangle, as though Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"" was a movie worth ripping off. ",0

194690, It will not give anything away if I say that Lian's real story is not revealed until the end and it is quite touching and genuine in its emotion.,1
147743," Although beautifully shot, this is surface-level only: besides the underdeveloped characters, the scenes of sexual violence are gratuitously repetitive.",1
73659," Sci-fi nuts, stoners and conspiracy theorists might get a kick out of this. But even Herzog fans will find this mix of found footage and Kinski-lite diatribe as frustrating as it's fascinating.",1
124170," That is the sign of a great storyteller - when they work, not in surprises, but in giving you exactly what you didn't know you wanted.",1
3673," As a children's fable, the film lacks magic, due to Weitz's uninspired helming and uneven technical execution, but it's likable, moderately engaging and well-acted by Dakota Blue Richards and Nicole Kidman; too bad Daniel Craig has such a tiny part.",0
11501, Pushes the envelope and pleases the palate with a colorful and unapologetic story that will burn in your memory banks.,1
155519," If it works at all, fitfully, it's because of the precociously talented and in-control Moretz, who basically carries the entire film on her own small shoulders.",0

64886, The office comedy is weak. The gross-out gags are too safe. A covert lesbian crush is underused.,0
185627," The flourishes of brutality, the pageantry of hardcore, the punchlines and slapstick gags: what's all this doing in an otherwise earnest film about deception and love?",0
92176," Well-woven, with the kind-hearted voices of psychiatrists, playwrights, family members, lawyers and the gregarious McCollum himself failing to come up with a solution on how to handle an autistic, obsessive and irresponsible rail rider.",1
58092," [Moretz] takes this fragile, confused girl and transforms her into a determined young woman, fighting for her self-identity. It's a performance as graceful and surprising as the film that carries it.",1
16278," Kyle Patrick Alvarez manages to create a mood so disturbing, intense, and believable that it's easy to forget we're watching a movie in spite of all the familiar faces.",1
234344," McLean has some skill, and we'll probably be hearing more from him in coming years, though I can't say I'm looking forward to it.",0
41404, This Disney drama manages to avoid patronising sentimentality with an uplifting and punchy look at the conflicts faced by 14-year-old Phiona.,1
65016," Klein creates a mood of tension, foreboding and sombre reflection through occasional moments of slo-mo and camera work that blurs reality. His literate script offers no easy resolution, only the faint hope that love can rescue two lost souls.",1
108969," Wow. I mean, really -- Wow!",1
194100," The second half is gripping. There's less time for talk, and the Smith brothers give us a superb sense of the fearful power of this landscape. Maybe that was the point all along: nature just keeps on giving and taking.",1
50656," The script itself is the real star of the show. It manages to elicit huge laughs without resorting to slapstick, and it finds humor in unlikely spots.",1
36757," Equal parts technically brilliant and racially repugnant, Bone Tomahawk offers up the very worst of the Western genre's xenophobia in a brutal package. ",0
24302," Shinichiro Ueda's innovative horror comedy proves there is still nourishment to be sucked from the zombie genre, if it's seasoned with a little heart and brains.",1

250806," The main theme of Rush | Time Stand Still is devotion: both that required by the band to stay together for 40 years...and that shown by its biggest fans, notoriously hard-core followers.",1
53582, Director John Hewitt gradually cranks up the tension in a violent thriller that unfolds against the lurid backdrop of big city prostitution.,1
91929, The low energy pace and performances strive for naturalism but just don't achieve compelling tension or suspense.,0
58807," While Jude Law summons all his energy to pronounce his many curse words with verve and feeling, no amount of f-bombs can launch him above a plot that was simply boring, and pacing that was awkward and excruciating.",0
16064, Intelligently addresses provocative issues... with two electrifying actresses.,1
176211, At once a summing-up of the Tavianis' filmmaking and an affirmation of their unshaken belief that human life is an uneasy compromise between the private and political spheres.,1
148487," Frances Lawrence appears to be under the impression he's making opera, but all he's doing is brewing a pot of Sleepytime Tea. ",0

217517, A competently made and mostly compelling chronicle.,1
61008," Overall, Morgen's film is a thoughtful examination of Goodall's work and an interesting presentation about a woman who made great strides both for science and for her gender.",1
136432, A coherent characterization of Robert Pattinson's striving schemer is nowhere to be found in this pedestrian period piece.,0
194445," ""An Eye for an Eye"" may very well be the most unpersuasive documentary ever made.",0
92741," 'Triangle' is one of the most intelligent, thought provoking genre films in recent memory.",1
50931," The drama is earnest and well-meaning, but it never generates the emotional wallop it aims for; even the conclusion, which should be shattering, falls short.",0
243699," While I'm not entirely sure that it makes much sense, I had a great time with its ultraviolent concoction of b-movie frippery.",1
148220, A deadly earnest and deadly dull psychological thriller.,0
118803," If the film is never quite as inert as The Da Vinci Code, I hesitate to call this a thriller. It's big, bombastic and glossy - but it is also stiff and sometimes ludicrous.",0
58096," Fleeting and superficial, it's the familiar, cliche-riddled show biz rise and fall with banal notes about substance abuse and the price of fame.",0

179533, Witherspoon is so inventive that she pulls laughs from even the lamest lines.,1
53464," Guadagnino claims that his Suspiria is not a remake at all but a cover version. If that's the case, it can only be the equivalent of turning a three-minute glam stomp into a bloated rock opera.",0
110753," Low-key adolescent angst, marred by the type of brief fantasy shots and sequences (the characters as rock stars, lip-synching 'Under Pressure') that have become a let's-go-for-an-easy-laugh crutch for filmmakers. ",0
251178," Vice worked my last nerve. It's true, I turned on it early, but trust me when I say it did nothing to endear itself to me as it went on.",0

141324," A number of scenes in the film are charming and engaging, with a genuinely unforced lightheartedness, and that takes more than a little expertise on the part of Ms. Maggenti, as well as her cast and other collaborators.",1
149240, The road from TV star to movie leading man is loaded with ill-conceived films.,0
43330," Peter Hedges (Lucas' father) directs here, eliciting great performances from his cast. I had heard Julia Roberts was sensational in this, but ... this is a career best.",1
45492," While it seems cruel to kick a person when she's down, it would be inaccurate to call Carey's performance anything other than groan-inducing.",0
106374," For a film that goes out of its way to proselytise about the pratfalls of pandering to the audience's expectations simply for the easy bucks, Anchorman 2 does just that.",0
224323, The film is purely family friendly and made solely for the intended audience.,1
52630," The delicately subversive [director] Mr. Panahi makes his subjects perfectly clear -- the stupidity of authority, and the hypocrisy of discrimination. Offside is surprisingly entertaining, and edifying to boot.",1
133164," Marshland is steeped in ominous atmosphere, but the intrigue packs few surprises - its murky political undertow never quite pays off.",0
206448, The new movie doesn't even try to grapple with what's in front of it.,0
172457," Set it against the shiny blandishments that have passed for family fun this season, and it starts to look vaguely radical.",1
48995," Even in this conglomerate era of marketed, predigested mediocrity, this Disney movie slips instantly into the humdrum",0
112112," Next to Mirren, [Reynolds is] like a dope in a museum, trying to be respectful of the genius around him but unable to sit still.",0
99544," True, Eclipse is at times ridiculously cheesy, but it's well made (apart from the odd dodgy CGI wolf) and there are knowing -- and humorous winks to the film's penchant for over-egged melodrama. ",1
9489, The tone varies wildly but there's still some fun to be had and the movie's massive budget shows up on the screen.,0
112901, This is too dull to function as a thriller and too silly to qualify as anything else.,0
210817," Aside from Coco choosing among dozens of numbered designer perfumes (No. 5 will do, thank you) there's no sense of her fashion spirit, as in Coco Before Chanel. Kounan simply designs a sexy knockoff for the back racks of biopics.",0
191482, Gemma Arterton's strong but shattered performance as a disconnected housewife bolsters Dominic Savage's thoughtful marital drama.,1
183055, Offers little that is new to anyone who has read (Louganis's) autobiography or seen the TV movie adapted from it. Not particularly interesting or well made.,0

37776, Easily one of the worst films in years.,0
250700," I'm almost inclined to write off The Killing of a Sacred Deer as a failed attempt to reconstitute the meaning of tragedy, a very ambitious but ultimately incoherent work of art. ",0
145000," Admirably idiosyncratic - thanks to its timely, politically provocative, fascistic undertones.",1
125135," Visually dazzling but narratively derivative and emotionally void, Luc Besson's out-of-this-world Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is a Pop Rocks movie.",0
153427, What this Japanese thriller lacks in mystery it more than makes up for in suspense and psychopathology.,1

84531," The rare movie that borrows elements from dozens of other films and TV shows, but is so good on its own that it almost doesn't matter. ",1

191585, Quick splashes of violence and a few cool twists will catch audiences off-guard.,1
48899," Pure joy and one of the best films of the year. You gotta have a good story, and this one is a gem. It even made a bit misty-eyed. Good stuff from Pixar. Paul Chambers, CNN.",1
21615," To feel gripped, on edge and moved in such a short period of time is of real commendation to Tyldum, who takes his audience through the motions in this unforgettable piece. ",1

229207, This film about the doomed love affair of poet John Keats and his neighbor Fanny Brawne left me underwhelmed.,0
55470," What could have been a beautiful mess, a work of pure chaos and absurdity in its strange choices that never come together, is instead dull, feeling overlong despite its incredibly reasonable 92 minute runtime.",0
109654," Chaitanya Tamhane's elegantly assembled and immensely powerful debut packs together observation, humanism, intelligence and beauty.",1
231536," Laced with enough laughs to make this work as both an action ride, and a comedy. Mirren and Malkovich steal the show.",1
248531," Director Terry Gilliam hasn't made a movie this playful since his Monty Python days, scattering visual and verbal puns throughout Grimm like Hansel and Gretel scatter breadcrumbs.",1
106163, Not even Gringo's impressive ensemble cast can breathe much life into these overblown but underwritten characters.,0
17849, Nasty and funny for about 30 minutes.,0
239051," While at times heavy-handed, Serkis' first swing at directing is efficient and effective.",1
127150, A film as provocative as curious and uncomfortably funny. [Full review in Spanish],1
247052," Rondón has clearly made precisely the film she intended to make. As downers go, however, it's lacking in catharsis. Life sucks, and then you cave.",1
183944, It's an enjoyable way to spend a couple hours. But don't expect to learn anything deeper of Raymond's life than what can be gleaned from his Wikipedia page.,0
241444, This fourth instalment will please the older fans of the series and should make some new ones amongst the audience who were too young to catch Scream on its first go round.,1
32102, A galvanizing sermon for those ready to hear it.,1
64438," You would expect this set-up to yield gripping suspense. The volatile Kyle shoots out TV monitors; Lee is forced to don an explosive vest; and SWAT snipers wriggle into position, trigger-fingers itching. Yet the drama proves surprisingly tepid.",0
171284," Try as it might to build a sense of mystery out of the story, No Stone Unturned actually doesn't have that much intrigue to work with.",0
27680," Despite boasting a seemingly ripe filmmaker working with proven actors, the result feels more like a bigger budgeted yet disappointing episode of The Outer Limits.",0
87040," The sight of Ledger with a camera in hand, often capturing his own reflection in a mirror, becomes the signature pose of the late actor, one that complicates what we know about him and what we should make of a mediated memorial like I Am Heath Ledger.",1
40673, The original Omen spawned two sequels. This lifeless remake guarantees we'll be spared the run-up to Armageddon.,0
35566," It sounds like so much attenuated tosh, but this bold, unique gem is bright, funny, brooding, hopeful, momentarily visionary, a wounded beauty exploring the creative process in a fresh and oft-brilliant fashion.",1
81315," Corpse Bride is interesting and a change of pace, but it could have been better. ... It seems a rush job, a blueprint that needed more details added.",0
165982," Someday someone is going to make a great film from a video game. Until then we have to be satisfied with being decently entertained without being hopelessly insulted. Prince of Persia manages to avoid doing either, so the wait continues.",0

173175," Sandrine Kiberlain shines in this pacy, Paris-set and just-silly-enough thriller. ",1
69262," The Lovers casts a longing glance over its shoulder at an older cinematic era while also remaining solidly rooted in the present. And like its protagonists, it revels in its double life.",1

90737," The blood and guts flow freely in Leatherface but it's never even remotely horrific, let alone so absurdly shocking that's it provides sick thrills. ",0
202389, Silly psychics make good characters but don't have enough to do,0
185609," Laden with dread and executed with a musician's sense of timing, The House of the Devil is better than a substantial number of the films it resembles.",1
217518," The impact is in the suggested and the unseen, rather than the gory and grotesque - just as it is like the best classic horror films.",1
175282," Better than part two, and almost scary in one part.",0
181125," This arty sci-fi thriller, adapted from a 2000 novel by Michael Faber, raises far more questions than it answers, yet that enigmatic quality is central to its appeal.",1
180540," Heads roll. And explode, en masse. Bodies are bisected. Vaughn is the sort of fellow who feels that if he hasn't taken things too far, he hasn't gone far enough.",1
211781," You realize the main drama of the movie - and Perry's career - is not that she has any special artistic talent, but rather the drive to take on an insane workload and see it through to the bitter end.",0
44382, It feels like the best work [McConaughey has] done in years and if there's a sequel I won't mind one bit.,1
193903, There's an eccentric individualism to [Greta] Gerwig's nimble approach to form and flow of dialogue.,1
7398," Michelle Williams shoulders the daunting task of portraying the screen legend, and though she requires a body double with the appropriate curves, she gives a sweet and nicely vulnerable performance.",1

169085, The director of A Good Year and Roxy Music's sumptuous Avalon video breathes more life into inanimate objets d'art than he does with Mark Wahlberg's inexpressive performance. ,0
242660, Thompson created a rebellious niche for himself in a business that more often than you might think channels its writers into conformist routine.,1
225747," For all Spielberg, his star-packed cast, led by Tom Hanks, and his on-screen and off-screen team (Joel and Ethan Coen co-wrote the screenplay) bring to the table, Bridge of Spies is remarkable only for how stuffy and surprisingly inert the film becomes.",0
48356," You better spend your hard-earned dollars on it, because none other than the queen of reinvention herself -- Cher! -- dazzles us with her presence!",1
46613, A glossy miscalculation with Nathan Lane and Robin Williams.,0
7614," This film's biggest problem is that even though it attempts to create many metaphors, most of them come off as requiring deep, personal explanations from Noé. ",0
213153," Malek is always a fascinating screen presence, but he can't do much with long stretches of silent contemplation, especially when half of those find him buried under silly mountain-man makeup.",0
35553, It's fitting that 'Gangster' Squad deals with crime because charging admission to this torpid film is robbery.,0
195465," There's a lesson in there about apathy and idealism, valuable because it comes at a time when doing nothing doesn't seem like a valid option anymore. It's also a lowkey remake of Hancock.",1
64683, Everything about it is meant to either raise or lower your expectations.,0
244251," It might not be great or legendary, but you are going to laugh. ",1
4622, They take big actor and actresses and put them in a movie that feels small and in a way that brings out more humanity in them.,1
4452," This is the best Thor-centric film in the Marvel universe yet, and hopefully it's a sign of more to come.",1
198717," Parvana copes by telling fables of wild animals and quests-these sections are dense and vivid, paper cutouts on layered backgrounds, providing cathartic levity in a very serious movie.",1
73645," In what plays like a modern take on The Godfather, queer sexual politics and Mexican machismo rasp upon each other, filing the young criminals at its heart into husks.",1
22899," A visual and emotional kaleidoscope, which draws on the language of comics and is based on a multireferencial script, full of action, formidable humor and timely comments on plurality. [Full Review in Spanish]",1

41681," In the hands of director Michael Bay, this battle is bound to be over the top, and the special effects amaze.",1
11972, like a two-hour car trip with different people taking turns complaining every 20 minutes,0
25468," The soundtrack might feel sourced from Rap Caviar, but the narrative structure is lifted from the '80s and the early '90s.",0
228725," A miserable, dejected little flick.",0
200314, What I liked about the film is that there is a very good cast. I think all the women in the film are terrific actors.,1
53736," There's no question where any of this is going, and although the chase can be entertaining at times, the movie is ultimately forgettable.",0
113580," One's appreciation of this regulation cable biodoc hinges on one's interest in the subject matter, not the medium.",0
152334," ...in TRAINSPOTTING the filmmakers are so far over the line, that I could not like the picture no matter how hard I tried.",0
19025, Filmmaker Gavin Hood's Ender's Game is an inquisitive sci-fi actioner that skillfully caters to the kiddie crowd while asking some mighty adult-oriented philosophical questions about the morality of war and the questionable boundaries of survival.,1

13383," With different filmmakers handling each segment, some obviously work better than others, but either way it is the book. ",1
44437," The Farrellys, New Englanders by birth, love the Red Sox so much that they forgive their lead character a multitude of sins that, in any of their other movies, they'd be too gentlemanly (and too humane) to ever allow.",0
135446, ...never has a uniform rhythm. [Full Review in Spanish] ,0
61230," The Water Horse is an extremely charming little children's film of the type that we unfortunately have been seeing less and less often, with just enough weight to truly earn the title 'a film for the entire family.'",1
33503," Understanding becomes the preliminary, if not foundational, weapon to exercise opposition. Although not entirely successful, American Dharma is a first step in that direction.",1
7162," As ever, Herzog leaves us as anxious and uncertain as we are thrilled.",1
20340," ...a sensational self-expose, in which the director presents us with any number of characters that ... reflect and represent various aspects of Todd Solondz",0
222535," I kept looking for the silhouettes of Joel, Tom Servo and Crow from the dearly-departed MST3K to appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.",0
166567, The performance of Vladimir Vdovichenkov is impeccable and the director Klim Shipenko knows how to generate tension. [Full review in Spanish],1
121054, This script ... is the sorriest piece of work that's been greenlit in over a year of weak Hollywood product.,0
63981," It might have taken David Cronenberg, that insect fetishist (Naked Lunch, The Fly), to truly turn this into a freak-out session.",0
173600," ""Partisan"" is slow and it is ambiguous but supremely sure of itself, as it moves, with singleminded grace from chilly to all-out chilling.",1

186281," If 20 Feet from Stardom has a flaw, it's one that's impossible to fix: It could be more, bigger, longer; it could be a miniseries, a Behind the Music of the voices you know but don't necessarily recognize.",1
58917," Finally, the feminist workplace comedy we've all been waiting for.",1
225360," There are fun beats to be found here, but it feels like an idea that began with its playful title and never went too far beyond that conceit.",1
88321," Much of the story seems distorted for melodramatic effect. The concept of the film makes it seem light, but the first reel is very violent and perhaps harrowing.",1
126458, Even a persuasive supporting cast gets Heaven only so far.,0
118532," In Taylor Hackford's ""Ray,"" Jamie Foxx delivers the season's most mesmerizing performance as late singer Ray Charles.",1
222080," It's a wonderfully delightful film filled with great performances, particularly from Firth and Rush. This is one of the best films of the year and should not be missed.",1
61889," Win It All has a wonderful lived-in tone and style, thanks to how Swanberg films and edits his movies. It's tense, funny, well-structured and carried by strong performances. And yet, there is something off about it.",0
138115, How does a first-time filmmaker put together a documentary as compelling and dramatic as this is?,1
9655," It's passionate, romantic, beautiful enough to inspire poetry, and extremely sad.",1
159456," I prefer the second movie, but The Hunger Games is something to see as a whole. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
147419, Engagingly photographed but dramatically inert.,0
241233," [A Simple Favor] is smart and funny, rife with twists that grow ever weirder and more extreme. With excellent performances and an entertaining story, it's a fantastic time at the movies.",1
145224," Buried is a brutal, relentless, mind-numbing thriller whose last five minutes will leave you absolutely breathless. ",1
148081," It's hard to imagine that the young Scorsese, a daring and innovative film stylist, would have settled for such a sodden and blandly archetypal treatment of such incendiary material.",0
219508," But after pondering the question of what makes us who we are over and over, you're reminded that the question is so much more captivating than the answers we're given here.",0
225551," Child was a large personality, and Meryl Streep is a great actress -- the combination does rather overshadow young Amy Adams in the role of Powell, the earnest disciple.",1
172387," Making Montgomery Clift adds up to a wonderful watch and a film that is easily recommendable. It's juicy enough to get the gossip hound salivating, but contains such a great amount of care and heart...",1
126360, Not just bad. Planet-smashingly bad.,0
7570," Cronenberg's directing style is elegant, all shiny surfaces and sleek camera moves, until the horror begins; then the film turns as dark and as bloody as the physical decay of its star-obsessed characters.",1
132310, Will appeal to Arthur C. Clarke fans who are tired of brainless blockbusters and wants a little bit more sci in their sci-fi . . .,1
186001," A Tolkien/Martin-esque sweeping intimate saga, prolific anime screenwriter Mari Okada's feature-length directorial debut is notable for its impressive visuals, emotional depth and syrupy score.",1
102942," Despite the breathtaking visuals and Lee's obvious reverence for the source material, The Hulk ultimately rates as a disappointment.",0
202980," Wan builds mounting dread with silence and suspense, lingering the camera unsettlingly long here, creaking a door there.",1
156968, All the action stuff is suitably epic and has seemingly been staged with criticisms of the other movies in mind.,1
6124," With Keaton in devastating overdrive, Moore can barely exercise her own brand of ginchiness.",0
795," A way-too-leisurely thriller whose destination is fairly obvious from early on, but to which the talented cast apply themselves with effortful seriousness.",0
83387," Worth seeing only for the mysterious adhesion process of Tautou's dresses and for Gilles Henry's glossy cinematography, which treats the luxurious Monte Carlo and Nice locations the way a tongue treats a lollipop.",0
65894, A lovely Japanese hand-drawn animated film with a female heroine.,1
89710," It's refreshing to see a high-concept movie that doesn't assume every love story has to reach a tidy conclusion, and implies that some happy endings are best left open-ended.",1
34243, How refreshing to watch idealism and sentimentality presented onscreen without the usual cheap manipulative tricks so beloved by Hollywood schlockmeisters!,1
113343," Mary is Happy, Mary is Happy is based on 410 consecutive tweets from a teenager called Mary Maloney. It's actually quite an intriguing, episodic attempt to channel a new form of communication into an old medium. Up to a point.",0
184725, ...wait until it is available for DVD rental and spend the money you saved to order a pizza.,0
129437," It's a button-pusher of a movie, as these inspirational sports films usually are. But that's okay.",1
54204," Sheer simplicity of the idea gets overwhelmed by, of all things, production values.",0
12885," A detective story that's riveting at times, but also periodically ridiculous, remaining in line with the helmer's frustratingly uneven filmography. ",1
157052," An abysmal waste of time and talent, a movie that takes a weak premise that could barely sustain a short homemade movie.",0
251492," It perverts cinephilia by asserting that anyone who engages in criticism actually, deep down, wants to be a practicing artist.",0
201377, Well-meaning but contrived ...,0
202218, So messy that it feels like it was peeled off the floor of a bathroom stall. It's moldy and cold. Nobody smart is anywhere in sight.,0
98604, Knowing how it all pans out doesn't make The Big Short any less compelling. These guys are continually questioned and ridiculed but you know they'll get the last laugh during the film's final act. ,1
199045, Surely to be considered at Oscar time.,1
167677," The results aren't quite so resonant, but the right notes are still being played, and we certainly come away fond enough of the characters and invested enough in their world to want to come back for more when it's ready.",1
17272, It ... brings fake-out jolts and humor into play.,0
119605," Cam is an effective, taut thriller that keeps the viewer engaged, and while it doesn't quite stick the landing, it is a compelling and satisfying watch.",1
122065, The makers of Rugrats in Paris wisely inserted just enough adult humor to keep mom and/or dad alert and amused-if not falling about laughing in the aisles.,1
229917, Entertaining enough but falls short of delivering much of anything new. ,0
81207," Watchable indie-by-numbers, enlivened by likeable performances from Emma Roberts and Michael Angarano...",1
58262, Like something imagined by Turgenev during what would have been even for him one of his more bleak interludes.,0
180623, An obnoxiously cute and mawkish man-and-his-mutt story...[with] one of the longest animal death watches in cinematic history.,0
115576," Every bit as noisy, brain-numbing and lowbrow as its predecessor, the Michael Bay production never strays from basic blockbuster formula.",0
183199," Interesting, edgy indie drama tackles racism, fitting in. ",1
59174, ...writer/director Edgerton does a superb job of ultimately subverting one's expectations...,1
112982, Becomes a moving examination of mortality and life choices.,1
33179," Eye-catching and moderately enjoyable...however, in spite of its many strengths the film winds up less clever than it obviously thinks it is.",1
72464," Winning enough to forgive some of its more egregious clichés, and exciting enough to ease up on its questionable found-footage logic.",1
197631," It's smart, funny and moving about human weakness. And it doesn't divide the world into good and bad adults - not counting that one bona-fide creep and his clueless squeeze.",1
90965, An immensely entertaining documentary about dancers performing in a grueling New York City audition for roles in a revival of A Chorus Line.,1
60643, Almost everything about this movie looks and feels right.,1
94883, J.J. Abrams' thrilling sci-fi adventure marks a rebirth in exciting galactic entertainment.,1

210947," While the acting styles of John Cassavetes and Charlton Heston clash like cymbals, director Larry Peerce preoccupies himself with grandstanding camerawork that does little to heighten tension or make us care for the potential targets.",0
44748, ... the first must-see of 2018.,1
197700," An unnerving honestly infuses this film, from its near-documentary visual style to the gritty truthfulness of the performances.",1
108244," Though the film defines Paul's life by his relationships, Eden fails to muster the kind of emotional intensity its story dictates.",0
221417," The film, a sleek and oddly moving study in the cost of debauchery, has its gleeful excesses.",1
100762," Of obvious interest to Thompson acolytes and of no obvious interest to anyone else. As a fan of Thompson and Robinson, I enjoyed the film's laid-back shagginess.",1
60516," The humor works because Robespierre parcels it out sparingly, at all the right (and wrong) moments, and because all the actors have serious chops.",1
2712," Aimed at creating a soldiers' eye-view of the four-year conflict, the result is a stunning piece of cinema.",1
89645," No doubt there is an audience ready to receive this relatively harmless, absolutely pointless, aggressively stupid, professionally realized pap. It will delight some people who will find it cute and take its casual blasphemies for a sense of humor",0
22739," With its clashing Titans, gorgeous costumes and toned bodies, Immortals has something for all, though its main appeal may be to those who enjoy slo-mo exploding heads in 3D.",0
176641," A good measure of the movie's white-knuckle fun comes from Craven's old-hand familiarity with the way thrillers tick, predicated on the smallest and most banal of missed connections, the kind that get an audience to go crazy.",1

151577," The Runaways is cool, but the Runaways were just so much cooler.",0
96848, The real reason for taking a chance on this minor summer confection would be to catch up on the life of an unbilled hero: Lloyd Dobler.,1
225324," From a philosophical viewpoint it's fitting that the inaugural movie to unite martial arts legends Jackie Chan and Jet Li is a fantasy film for young teenagers. Forbidden Kingdom"" may not be ""Enter the Dragon,"" but it's not supposed to be.",1

25215, Extraordinary across the boards. ,1

188324, The dogs are able to emote way more than (Paul) Walker can.,0
14342, This bare-bones adaptation is more of a sop to the musical's fans than a fully imagined movie musical.,0

33522," Morris's commentary comes in the form of stunning images ... and a truly beautiful score ... The Unknown Known is revealing, but what it reveals is emptiness.",1
138345," Bringing Wilson's plays to wider audiences is a good thing. Fences preserves the drama, if not quite translating it into film. ",1
45155," Underwritten, dramatically shallow and visually disappointing; unlike the myths on which it is based, Immortals will be quickly forgotten.",0
6500," Whatever your foreknowledge of low-budget Brooklyn dramedies, it's impossible that Gillian Robespierre's film won't lob you at least a few curveballs.",1
196835, Jake Johnson brings a type of charisma and serious humor that's no different than his past roles in New Girl and Drinking Buddies. His way of acting really helps to tell a very real story of a man on a downward spiral.,1
229134, This crime thriller's script plays more like an early draft that still lacks the nuts 'n' bolts crime and nervy thrills,0
45173, Johnny Knoxville dons latex to play a wildly inappropriate grandfather in a Borat-style feature film. Guilty sniggers follow.,1
88026, A colorful but violent narration on the loss of hope. [Full Review in Spanish],1

125715," Claudio Miranda's luminous camera, set to Mychael Danna's intoxicating score, captures all manner of wild delights.",1
144270, An underappreciated classic of the western genre; one that functions as a proto-revisionist piece repositioning one of the stories of the Old West to a Mexican perspective,1
17023," (W)hat's clear about John Hamburg's trend following entertainment is that it feels forced together, as if a smart, sunny couples comedy was injected with a copy of Jokes from the John.",1
144500, A wonderful cast that is more than capable of making these dim lights shine.,1
30360, [Jackson] deftly nagivates a path between the dark perils of JRR Tolkien's fantasy world and the necessary jokey lighter moments.,1
183948," Four Brothers is a violent, macho story with a perfect feel for the dynamics between four tough guys who will do anything for each other.",1
133020, Watching Frank Langella in this film is like seeing a brilliant new actor give his breakthrough performance.,1
202035," Those who didn't sleep through their mythology classes might recall that Helius was in fact the son of Hyperion. But, you know, Greek mythology? Whatevs, bro! Have another Tecate! ",0
251864," As a big fan of Alien, I really enjoyed this... to a point. Then the second half left me thinking of the Geico commercial with the fisherman saying 'oooh you almost had it.' ",0
196463," Makes for a good anti-war doc, to be sure, but an even finer -- and painfully accurate -- portrait of the former soldier as a young man.",1
134221, The only crime that interested me in White Boy Rick was McConaughey stealing this movie. And the filmmakers know it.,0
124265," At World's End's greatest sin, just like the second film, is that it forgets to be fun.",0
182915," The second half is chilling and well directed, culminating in a high-wire act of a finale.",1
104914," The King is a visual essay - it proposes a thesis, then builds a convincing argument, bouncing between Presley's life and the state of the nation.",1
68820, The disorienting film takes devious delight in layering various versions of the stories so that we feel like we're jurors looking into a courtroom lined with funhouse mirrors.,1
171606," It shows Chaplin mixing slapstick with heartbreak like nobody else could. It's plotted in an episodic fashion, but each piece of the puzzle is also a memorable, entertaining bit in and of itself.",1
169142," Such a beautiful movie -- and so cold, too.",0
178210," More than an appreciation, Pete Seeger: The Power of Song is an inspiration.",1
190449, What seems most remarkable in that hotel room in Hong Kong is Snowden's freedom from anxiety. ,1

141973, What substance Harry Brown has -- beyond selling fear and cynicism -- lies deep in the still-compelling eyes of Michael Caine.,1
133087," Sommers would have done better if he had spent more time on character development (including some of the animal characters) and less on turning Mowgli into Indiana Jones. In some ways, this is as cartoony as the '67 version.",0
70457," Dujardin and Bejo have previously starred together in OSS 117: Cairo, A Nest of Spies, with the chemistry clearly already there, Hazanavicius was wise to cast them again.",1
123253," The Town showed that you could take a well-worn premise and still make something fresh and interesting with it. Most of the time people try to do that, they end up with a movie like The Eagle.",0
207762, This Death at a Funeral - even when it's copying the original gags almost shot for shot - doesn't capture the manic intensity of the original film.,0
115501, It's a comedy -- almost -- about how the mobile phone and the internet have murdered intimacy. It's not necessary to believe all of its atrocities to find it terrifying.,1
17911," while Wang hits some high notes with a few scattered flights of fancy, he mostly bungles this girl and her dog tale with painfully awkward direction and mind-numbing treacle",0
66971, The movie's few ideas circle around each other without going anywhere.,0
78355," The focus is solely on the internalized motives of these characters. Despite this, Stalker remains a lucidly visual film.",1
155965," Save the highly predictable decider, the on-court battles are satisfyingly fast and fierce, but the tension they generate is undercut by the labored Oedipal melodrama that contains them.",0
201687," Moore gives a superb performance, see it",1
170770," Chapel is pitching a gem, but the movie doesn't spend nearly enough time on baseball -- you find yourself glancing at your watch while Costner steps off the mound or walks in slow circles or takes his time throwing to the plate.",0
44721, Neruda feels like such a leap into the unknown that it's almost outside the solar system - it's the Pluto of Larraín's filmography so far.,1
94262," It's us humans who are the monsters in this flipped world, which only goes to show - once more - how everything is relative. The comedic premise stands up well...",1
78010, Lanthimos's unsettling tour de force reminds us of how chained to coupledom dignity remains at both the private and public level.,1
216000," Horrible Bosses 2 is an inferior sequel in nearly every way - it has less laughs, less chemistry, and a much less compelling story, which doesn't even get going until more than halfway through the film.",0

153255," What's needed is someone nervous to play Henry. A Steve Buscemi, for example. Reeves maintains a sort of Zen detachment.",0

16441," It sparks interesting discussion on what actually is funny, what should be considered funny, who to respect as far as comedians go",1
187809," While Mark Decena, who directed the film and wrote it with Timothy Breitbach, is good at creating convincingly intimate, casual conversation, the story does begin to feel somewhat undernourished, visually and dramatically.",0

131617," The film is understandably talky, but there was enough passion and drama in it to hold my attention. It is a good primer on psychoanalysis.",1

65447," Unsettling and at times uneven, but always fascinating material for anyone prepared for a grim ride.",1
142603, To remake Rocky Horror with slavish nod after nod to the original film is an exercise in redundancy. Why not reinvent the pig instead of just throwing more glitter on it?,0

15570," Spurlock's stunts only prove that the strategy works, not what can be done besides beware, except he makes it seems so cheery. I'll certainly keep his sponsors in mind when needing air travel, a soft drink or a shampoo fit for humans and horses. ",1

209009," While it's never plain bad, the film is not really plain good, and very seldom plain funny. (Mildly amusing fits.)",0
202484," You will learn virtually nothing from this movie, except that Eva Green has very nice breasts.",0
226923," A drab exercise in poor storytelling, empty-headed characters, low-grade aesthetics, and forgettable action sequences. This isn't 'so-bad-it's-good' we're talking about; it's 'so-bad-it's-bad.'",0
34771," Be afraid.... Be also amused, in a deeply weird, weirdly deep sort of way... by how Quentin Dupieux gives us this unlikely tale, through a lens of cinematic quantum mechanics, a we-view-it-therefore-it-exists sort of thing.",1
183326," Tests one's patience while basically boiling down to a lot of squabbling between characters not worth caring about. ""Riddick"" is a blah effort, sinking into mediocrity when all involved are capable of so much more.",0
161892," The focus... gets diluted by a wholly superfluous romance (and songs, tuneful as a couple are), and a face-off between the guy awash in goodness who asks all the right questions and the bad godman who has all the wrong answers.",0

99512," Can't help but be good based on the songs alone, but should have had more of an emotional and dramatic impact.",1
227853," Always Shine is a potent psychological thriller, all right. But it's also a powerful statement on the very industry that produced it.",1
94709," Watching Adams attempt to teach the aliens English is remarkably gripping, aided by some genuinely breath-taking shots.",1
181198," It's probably a little too modest for its potential Oscar goals, but it's a fine film nonetheless.",1

194311," As ultraviolent as the first film, and as ultrasmutty, The Golden Circle will leave the Kingsfans grinning, even if its characters have less growing to do this time around.",1
144203," The result is a top-class courtroom drama, thanks to a beautifully balanced screenplay, top-notch performances from the ensemble cast and a nagging sense that, even almost 80 years on, this sort of injustice still hasn't gone away.",1
224734," This one is played in broad, sitcommy fashion, utterly divorced from the way people behave in real life.",0

228241, It's a huge testament to the actors that you can sympathize with a character one minute and hate him/her the next.,1
228454," In The Girl in the Spider's Web... what is great about the casting is the unexpected role of Lisbeth Salander as delivered by Claire Foy. This was a genius move on the part of [director Fede] Álvarez, and is what makes the film worth watching.",1

67231, Less a parenting allegory than a study in people's perverse curiosity about the unknown.,1

56272," All About Steve is a messy assemblage of clumsy sight gags, winking reaction shots and disingenuous populist genuflection to the idea that there's no such thing as normal. We all see a little bit of Mary in ourselves, don't we? Don't we?",0
248955, Costner tells a personal story that never loses touch with the vast Western spaces encompassing and defining it. Dances With Wolves is an epic that breathes. And it's a beauty.,1

186320," Bizarre and graphic, unforgettable and unpredictable.",1
71015," There's a purity to the utter lack of rationale here; this, combined with Michôd's way with a landscape, makes for a passable guy-picture masquerading as something deep.",0
74909," The film seems comfortable with [the police's tactics], and also with removing the pesky question of motive from its prime movers: it's enough that they're bad guys who did a very bad thing and must be brought to justice.",0
109959, The story gets as melodramatic as anything in Amy Tan.,0
248357," Stick with it. There are shocking acts that rupture the stillness, and then there's one of cinema's great endings, a wrenching, rapturous scene that would set both of those poets into embarrassed rewrites.",1
135529," It's an emotional ride, to be sure, prompting many an affectionate grin and an occasional tear. And none of that would be possible if not for the sensational lead performances by Steve Coogan as Stan and John C. Reilly as Ollie.",1

226315," The boom-and-bust cycle that afflicts company towns in capitalist countries also dogs the state-run cogmakers, as Chinese auteur Jia Zhang-ke lyrically depicts in 24 City, an ode to changing times.",1
156031," Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg milk dry their default movie personas, but it's all part of the joke -- and what a great joke it is.",1
138868," The man who once stole every film he did, bending it to his comic will, tranquilly inhabits LOST IN TRANSLATION... Understatement is his tool now.",1
214757, The Hummingbird Project is a pretty ambitious film and offers fine performances but the film as a whole falls pretty far short of expectations.,0

193455, Gambling tales are a hard sell. But this one is on a lucky streak. Great performances from Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn. ,1

196132," Cage's old pal Dominic Sena is a decade removed from their ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" directing glory, and he gets nothing out of this script that isn't pure hokum.",0
91158, There's a lot more to Ira Sachs' indie drama Little Men than initially meets the eye.,1
47781, This Far From the Madding Crowd is to be commended most for the nuances that it never sacrifices.,1
40466," In the end, the film wants to imply that the love of a supportive partner can overcome any problem, no matter how insurmountable it may seem. But that overly optimistic view is less than convincing.",0
154593," A strong entry in the comic-book superhero action film genre, with a plot that's compelling without being confusing, great special effects, strong villains, some inspirational 'girl power' scenes, crisp pacing....",1
145510, A disenchanting rain of colors that spans 150 minutes that will continue for years to come. [Full review in Spanish],0
230960," The movie's compelling, what-the-hell mood drains away into a series of disappointed shrugs with the occasional disbelieving snort. ",0

23820," Bittersweet, slow-moving period piece has sex, drugs.",1
66085, Paper Towns works better on paper than in practice; its ideas are infinitely preferable to the experience of watching the film.,0
228004, No amount of fireballs or car chases are able to stop the whole thing being really boring.,0
198538, The most surprising thing about Ti West's In a Valley of Violence is how funny it is. That's not something you'd necessarily expect from a revenge Western.,1
64719," Spaceship is laden thick with production design. Locations speak to the film's banal residential setting, while the costumes, hair and make-up veritably bellow, ""Yes, we are all individuals!""",0

179124," The two lead actors, and the careful direction by Aisling Walsh are what make this film work. ",1
110646, The world hasn't been craving another Men In Black sequel as much as Will Smith's agent. ,0
186543," Preposterous and slightly cheesy, like an ""erotic thriller"" from the 1990s.",0
1704," A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan. He may have meant the Internet short Saving Ryan's Privates. But Windtalkers doesn't beat that one, either.",0
140419, That's why Kidman holds our attention so: she's like the film's collective conscience.,1
49925," The titular act of violence is the best scene in the film, radiating a kind of unavoidable fatality that elevates the lethal gunshot from a just another bang to something triggering a very strong sense of epochal change.",1

42603, Evil Dead 2's rampant inventiveness and manic energy have ensured that it will endure as a cult classic.,1
147869," In the 13 years since it was released to a predictably puzzled family audience, Tim Burton's macabre stop motion musical has wound its way through cult affection (and survived mall-Goth appropriation) to earn its rightful place as a genuine classic.",1
111436," This is a bitter, jagged, disaffected drama, pessimistic about China, pessimistic about the whole world.",1
158549," It's not groundbreaking and will appeal to horror fans mostly, but Kerslake, and the excellent Quinn Markey, give it a dramatic centre.",1
181259," Delivers a few pleasant surprises, including a smart story -- a reverse-E.T. riff that plops an American astronaut down in a world of just-like-us-only-green creatures -- and clever characters...",1
85479, Frenetic action and unbridled chaos is the name of the game in this espionage action thriller in which Mark Wahlberg reunites with director Peter Berg for 94 minutes of high-octane thrills. ,1

127709, This film was a cultural turning point and continues to be.,1
86536, The film breaks faith with its audience by asking us to care about two profoundly antipathetic characters spouting pseudo-poetic banalities.,0
199762," Even though it's not among his best films, I'm just happy that Tim Burton has finally made a movie I can recommend to people again. ",1
29043," Yes, cancer sucks. But frankly, there's nothing distinctive about this documentary, even though it's about a very distinctive person.",0
145532," By rights, Gilda Bessé (Charlize Theron) should be languishing in a grand 1940s melodrama.",0
235434," Sanchez and Myrick's film knows that what's not seen frightens more easily that what is, and that the imagination's thoughts of what might have happened generally horrify on a deeper level than knowing what did.",1

171987, I found it more pleasurable as a time waster than either Mission: Impossible.,1
184057, A star-driven pseudo-indie affair that will please neither celebrity worshipers nor cineastes.,0
104187, Antonio Campos's character study of a prep school social misfit named Robert (Ezra Miller) is an intimate psychological journey into a coded juvenile mindset.,1
54705," At points, the film sinks below the level of competent: A stupid plot trick early on is so badly edited that it takes another minute to figure out what's supposed to be going on.",0
121355," A relationship dramedy wields little power without an emotional punch. And when the theatrical (literally) climax attempts bold emotionality, one can't help but wince.",0
207832, It's very funny and offers an amusing take-down of the pretentiousness of the art world and the way that it can be corrupted and co-opted by big money.,1
104787," The King's Speech is a warm, wise film -- the best period movie of the year and one of the year's best movies, period.",1
179538," Thanks to Kevin James' earnest portrayal of an earnest guy, I was won over by the film's goofy charms.",1
183647, Some filmmakers put feelings into words; Malick uses smoke signals and semaphore to express things felt but unspoken. How you interpret them is up to you.,0
182892," When I walked out, I was left wanting, more mindful of unfulfilled promise than impressed by half a good movie. I cannot claim this is a bad movie, I simply cannot say it is a truly good one overall.",0
190573," Vanilla Sky offered Crowe a chance to prove himself as an artist, but all it does is show once again that he is an able draftsman.",0
97990," Intriguing, frequently confusing, but mostly entertaining, Matrix Revolutions wraps up the trilogy's narrative loose ends in a reasonably satisfying fashion.",1

143053," We leave the film having learned very little, other than that this exceptional long distance runner is certainly quite an athlete.",0
172569," Arterton brings a grace and dignity to the role, which suggests reserves of courage in her character that the screenplay only hints at.",1
164752, How better to locate such counterintuitive heroics than through a retroactive contextualizing of Churchill as a least-likely-to-succeed buffoon (albeit with a gift for rhetoric)? Cue Gary Oldman as Oscar bait.,0
68303, What Svengali effect does [Rob Marshall] have over top-of-the-line actors that lures them into such assaults on good taste?,0
225321, The scenes in the museum are overextended to the point of viewer frustration.,0
8665," The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom, but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing.",0
211339," An especially lame comedy based on nothing but a situation. The humor is farce or slapstick, so character development doesn't matter. Establish the types, put them in one crazy mix-up after another and you're done.",0

204910, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again is one word: delightful,1
14395, A performance like Swinton's - so gorgeously and painfully calibrated - is something to behold.,1
38150, To shackle two lovely and promising teenage actresses to material this dreadful could be reasonably construed as an awfully expensive form of child abuse.,0
161646," An energetic return to form reminding audiences, both young and old, why everyone should love The Muppets.",1
85602," Despite year-end plaudits and the promising reunion of Haynes and cinematographer Lachman, this proves a fairly anemic forbidden-love melodrama ... Blanchett turns in a rare one-note performance.",0
29139," Endearing and astutely engaging, this deliciously tart comedy is, essentially, a British film that revives the old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland 'let's put on a show' formula with great panache.",1
50566," ...Singer and company are so concerned about doing justice to Superman's past, they fail to generate much interest in what, if any, future the franchise might have.",0
83888," Castellitto clings to the Duraflame fires within for Twice Born, a handsomely crafted but empty feature hoping to recreate Eastern European horror and soap opera intimacy.",0
51346," It's also, arguably, the most affecting work Bale has ever done in a role specifically written for him by his Out of the Furnace director Scott Cooper. You know it from the moment he puts those eyes on you.",1
89974," The rambling, staggering story line toggles clumsily between depictions of natural disasters and human error and/or treachery without ever hitting anything like a stride...",0
24979," Watching this overproduced movie, which is devoid of real plot or characters, is like spending a day in amusement park, taking rides that vary in excitement, at the end of which you feel saturated and exhausted.",0

7251," As much as I'd love for a movie called Jurassic Five, this saga isn't evolving, and probably should stop trying.",0
95602, Way overrated M. Night Shyamalan-type sci-fi-horror hybrid with serious credibility issues and too many jump in your face moments.,0
153641, This tale of a brilliant sociopath is disturbing and often uncomfortable to watch. And it's also magical filmmaking.,1
63751," This is a movie that thinks a hit in the gut is a perfectly suitable punch line; as such, watching it often feels like enduring repeated blows to your own solar plexus.",0
199402, Dour and schematic drama about disenfranchised factory workers.,0
99688," Turner's great oils and watercolors... seem indistinct at first but consist of a wealth of details that eventually merge into a clear picture. Leigh's movie does the same, building a full portrait from a series of vignettes.",1
43132, An intriguing new subgenre that might be described as 'Sundance science fiction' continues with this creepy but ultimately unpersuasive film.,0
229214," No arguing with the message: The movie's eager to tell its audience (especially young viewers) that there's life beyond a basketball court, and they ought to prepare for it.",1
185815," Endless rounds of boisterous battle scenes and eardrum annihilating explosions, until you couldn't care less which side wins. So if there's any real human passion rising to the surface amid the rubble, it's all about the guns, baby.",0
179728," This is a premise that might work in the hands of more eager filmmakers, but here it is reduced to a collection of fragmented scenes designed to mystify and infuriate. ",0
69382, Brazilian drama about a misogynistic slave owner and those suffering under his control.,1
110919," ...this flick is so desperate to be hip that it ultimately feels as relevant as ""Mr. Belvedere""... If you have to ask what that is, then you probably won't enjoy this movie. ",0
53114," In the end, viewers waiting for an emotional and/or dramatic payoff will be disappointed. As a call-to-arms, it's highly sympathetic but surprisingly mild-mannered.",0

176213, Think of Roger Dodger as a less mean-spirited version of Your Friends and Neighbors.,1
174566," College Road Trip hurts more than just the eyes and ears, it wreaks havoc on one's humane sensibilities.",0
172783, The movie's heart is certainly in the right place -- it's a quietly outraged work -- but I wish there were more excitement in it from moment to moment.,1
55218," Despite some scattered big laughs from this collection of insufferable characters, we too often laugh at them rather than with them, and the tedious film ultimately suffocates from its quirks.",0
110560," It manages to get into those messier struggles of balancing faith and religion. The result is a quietly contemplative character piece, grounded by a characteristically terrific performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor.",1
56099, Lacks the requisite passion and urgency to make the experience anything more than a periodically pleasant waste of time.,0
219432," The borrowings from other movies, going all the way back to the car chase in 1968's Bullitt, are heavy. But Bay has three leads to lend weight and dimension to characters who are hardly original and flatly written.",1
224566," Logan Lucky is like those inline tube slides at a water park: you don't worry about where you're going, because getting there is so much darned fun.",1
8699," This film, directed by Michael O'Shea, is less a horror movie than a coming-of-age tale as Milo meets an equally troubled neighbour, Sophie, played by Chloe Levine.",0
114182," Rich, deep and eventually very moving.",1
112737," Deeply informed documentary that puts Pussy Riot into the context of the Russian avant-garde that is rooted in ""Actionism"".",1
217685," If you must see one of the two Presidential daughter movies - this is the one to see. But like Chasing Liberty, it never delivers on the potential of the premise. ",0
76936," The movie itself feels a little out of date, taking place in the present, but emotionally invoking a world of Enrons, Bernie Madoffs, tech bubbles and Wall Street meltdowns.",0
90087, It's a case of truth in advertising.,0
224694," George calls funk the bridge between soul music and hip hop, and he builds a strong case. Funk refused to be put in any box. Wherever it came from, and wherever it's still doing, it gets your motor moving.",1
218275," In its minimal, low-budget way, Paranormal Activity 2 summons some chills, but it's most of all a scheme to make millions from a miniscule investment. ",0
84209," Murray gives it his all, which is always worth seeing, but everything about the production seems to have been designed with one goal in mind: to snag its star an Academy Award.",0
56031, Ridiculous yet entertaining.,1
103698, Reverential retrospective revisiting the rise and fall of an irreverent humor franchise.,1
134219," Heartbreaking, joyous, sad, and glorious, Mommy is pure exhilaration.",1
1411," On the basis of stunts, special effects and pure action, it delivers sensationally.",1
118290," This dismal comedy, scripted by Murray's old pal Mitch Glazer (Scrooged), evinces only enough interest in Afghanis to keep the story rolling.",0
249891," Gru's villainy is replaced by a cloying fish-out-of-water mentality that is tortured by overuse of the minions characters. Still, the film is entertaining and has several wonderful scenes that almost make up the difference.",1
136791," If you're expecting the same kind of chilling horror the first Strangers delivered, you might be disappointed with The Strangers: Prey at Night.",0
149408, At this point it's fair to say that Jackson's weakness for narrative bloat has now officially defeated him.,0
102835, Nothing is solved as fighters on both sides die and that's the end of the story. ...So what's left? ,0
225718," ""Alex Cross"" is a grim yet silly piece of work, even as serial-killer thrillers go.",0
123821," In all fairness, Albert Camus' short story L'hote (The Guest) may be too spare and lean to fill a full-length feature film. But also in all fairness, it captures its issues in a far more concise and eloquent manner then David Oelhoffen's film.",0
102588," Best described as the diametric opposite of a refreshing shower, William Lustig's Maniac has long been reviled as one of horror's truly ugly films.",0
114564," Ineffectual, irrelevant and amateurishly conceived from start to finish, this movie is so bad it could kill off Nancy Drew forever.",0
31672," When they're not risking their lives with exciting spy maneuvers, Blaster works out to Lady Gaga and Juarez updates her Facebook page. Okay, so maybe G-Force is just a tad self-consciously 'hip.' [Blu-ray]",0

202828," Short on laughs, even at 87 minutes.",0
79966," It's a sad, angry excuse for a comedy that contains exactly one chuckle and infinitely more cringing.",0
179629," The film gets on screen not only the play's bloody, double-dealing, hungry essence, but the redemptive potential of art.",1
94842, What makes Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close good is its sense of goodness. ,1
124422," ""Veep"" creator Armando Iannucci and his remarkably comedic cast produce some very big laughs, particularly in the early going.",1
139424, The film's nuanced view of social issues is complemented by lovely black-and-white animation work that blends Islamic motifs into a sort of Yellow Submarine-ish world.,1
27433, An oddly juiceless older woman-younger man romance.,0
67977," Ultimately, this is a film that has its heart in the right place, that wants to discuss the depths of the opioid crisis...But its superficiality stops it from finding a strong center of pathos, and a final act shift becomes unintentionally comical. ",0
172764," And then there's Josh Hartnett, what can I say... Who knew he had such a performance in him?",1
62828, Martin Scorsese's elephantine exercise in B-movie badness.,0
13550, The story doesn't hold up to the least bit of logical scrutiny.,0
243592," The visuals, the structure, the use of sound and music, and the simple presence of a beating heart - all come together in a whole that is truly breathtaking.",1
17336," Once the film has blown it's CGI load, it turns into a kitchen sink drama, an episode of Eastenders as directed by Mike Leigh.",1
60657," Too unfocused to be good, too packed full of ideas to be entirely bad, it should become quite the cable television staple in just a few years' time.",0
231086," The screenplay wades through a stream of absurd situations during the trip, but they're treated with an earnest, understated hand that keeps the focus on the characters. ",1

68158," The movie feels at odds with itself, embracing the comics' idiosyncratic creations without an idiosyncratic worldview.",0
251299, Somehow the knowledge that you are three degrees of separation from Dabney Coleman and a computer called W.O.P.R. transforms trite claptrap into the words of the Bard himself.,0
176942, Comedy and drama are nicely balanced in this mostly true tale.,1
238429, Thrills are utterly lacking in the film.,0
152618, Green orchestrates all this with some skill but not too much gore. A minor tour de force.,1

183194," We're all going to be miserable after watching England Is Mine, the story of his (Morrissey's) early years in Manchester, which, infuriatingly, features barely a note of The Smiths or, indeed, much of the wonderfully evocative music of the period.",0
71603," ""Lean on Pete"" demands a different kind of attention from moviegoers. But the rewards are worth it.",1
218744," It's a prison film and a social-realist picture of the Loachian school: fierce, unsentimental, engrossing.",1
12180," Dreyer's Ordet (1955) is far simpler than his previous films, taking place mostly in a single set, but also more complex.",1
165545," Death Note carries a weirdly perfunctory air about itself throughout, even as the bodies begin to fall closer and closer to its main duo.",0
217878," It certainly doesn't help that these characters just aren't worth a two-hour investment. Unless you're a fan of independent music, there's little chance you'll want to spend that much time with them.",0
61959," Chasing the ghosts of past glories in the name of product allegiance, Die Hard 4.0 clatters noisily down the lift shaft into oblivion.",0

152934," There isn't much talking in Roma, nor are there many close-ups of the characters - faces and words are forgotten as time passes; and Alfonso Cuaron wants his film to feel like a half-remembered dream, washed away by the tide of time. ",1

134769," Witches are making a pop culture comeback, so it's not a surprise that Sam Levinson's Assassination Nation trades on that rudimentary metaphor as a starting point for this horror-comedy cum political manifesto.",1

171158," Victoria is thrilling cinema, and just plain thrilling, too.",1

158125," [VIDEO ESSAY] Yes, this movie is even worse than ""Battlefield Earth.""",0
29337," Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was the best thing about the swampy Batman v Superman, and now her solo outing is the far superior film: Wonder Woman, directed by Patty Jenkins, elevates her from third wheel to real deal.",1
133712, It is unfortunate that instead of exploring the universal challenges and complexities of forgiveness it stays within the safer confines of preaching salvation to those who have already been persuaded.,0
100067," Gareth Edwards' independently made road/horror/politico/sci-fi film, gets all the points in the world for trying, but it ultimately comes up way short",0
107577," The strength of the personal narrative combined with a fine balance of dark and comedic tones, as well as an overall excellent cast, makes this film well worth the watch.",1
68403," An incredibly silly and tedious exercise, restricted by the constraints of its PG-13 rating, an absence of imagination and a complete lack of personality.",0
153549," Double Take is a very entertaining film and is at times very funny -- aside from the Hitchcock intros, there is also the strange comedy double act of Nixon and Khrushchev.",1

208129," Like all the best sci-fi, Arrival isn't really about aliens. It's about people. It's about ideas. But instead of hammering you over the head with those ideas in a bid to show how clever-clever it is, the film lets the story and characters do the talking.",1
92156," An incongruous mix of fable and realism, giddiness and gloom, The Beaver gnaws off more than it can chew, but Mel Gibson's earnest performance and Jodie Foster's able direction shore up the dam.",1

221397, A heart-searing drama that slides effortlessly from real life to animated tales to a monster hewn from a yew tree (and some top-notch motion-capture CGI).,1
223293," Despite its curiously stoic tone, A Mighty Heart retains its capacity to fascinate and intrigue",1
117365, There's very little to distinguish The 5th Wave from all the other young adult dystopias that came before it...a completely boilerplate and often slipshod production. ,0

206528, There's so much wrong with the basic setup of [the film] that it never really gets a chance to be as funny as it could be.,0
50104," Landesman has pushed too hard to make this story fit into a dramatic mold, alternating melodrama and romance with those earnest warnings in a way that is more ungainly than effective.",0
93527," ""Tangled"" is consistently enjoyable, and a few scenes that feature glowing, floating, pink-and-orange lanterns are quite pretty, but it's also unmemorable.",1
17096, An exemplary coming-of-age tale not least because it so gracefully transcends its genre.,1
16807," Director Ken Marino's ensemble romantic comedy, mixing adorable canines and humans who need as much rescuing as the animals they adopt, is something of a shaggy charmer itself.",1
111602," Strickland has created a sublime piece of cinema that is intelligent, comic and one of the most profoundly disturbing films to be seen in recent years.",1
36923," Redmayne applies lippy, dresses in 1920s women's clothes and performs surely the most tastefully executed mangina so far in cinema history - not a highly competitive field, but progress of a kind.",1
96410," Chastain is so good at the steely-eye determinism of Sloane, in the believability of what she does, and in making us understand why she does it, that the character is likable and even relatable despite her repugnant win-at-all-cost methods.",1
199896," For all of its precise direction and beautiful imagery, it's a classic genre picture, and a damn good one at that...",1
248124, A very aptly named movie.,0
233009," Director Marc Forster gets the action scenes right but never shapes the film as a whole. And if Craig, a talented actor, wants to be a Bond for the ages, he needs to lighten up. James Bond shouldn't be all work and no play.",0
105095," Fey can't save this disjointed, war comedy.",0
250577, The bones of a good idea for a conspiracy thriller lie buried in the corpse of Vantage Point. It feels more like a movie with a personality disorder.,0

135411," Dead Man's Burden isn't [great], but it's not a bad horse opera and is unflinching in its depictions of harshness and violence.",0
232600," A solid, if somewhat heavy-handed, account of the near-disaster that befell NASA's 1970 mission to the moon, done up by Howard with a steady, if not very imaginative, hand.",1
136566," It seems more like an illustration of his script than a full-fledged movie, proving how much he needs a Spike Jonze or a Michel Gondry to realize his surrealistic conceits.",0

170098," Won't be [director Brad] Anderson's big breakout, but it's a respectably eerie endeavor.",1
102569," No more can filmmakers get instant laughs with Pong, ascots, eight-tracks and lava lamps. It's just no longer funny. And for 95 percent of its running time, neither is Semi-Pro.",0

177791, The definitive look at the nuclear power industry focused on a plant that conceivably lead to a disaster greater than Fukushima..,1
244907, The suspense isn't suspenseful. The plot twists are transparent. The pacing of the film is rocky. And the movie has the subtlety of a gorilla with a jack-hammer.,0
16653, The relentless intensity quickly grows numbing.,0
11762," dips into some heady issues (fate, free will, the relationship between humankind and its creator) while remaining in a fundamental mode of popcorn-munching entertainment. ",1
190620," While Step Brothers, the latest from writer-director Adam McKay, is just an excuse to get Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly behaving like spoiled brats for 90 minutes, it nonetheless results in a perfectly funny movie.",1
107655," Filled with pratfalls, slapstick and toilet humour, this furry nonsense with an eco-friendly message is harmless family fun. ",1
168846, The world's most expensive home movie.,0
166326," (The film) has a hard time settling on such simple things as characters' motivations, needs and accents (Cage's changes inexplicably midway through).",0
183471, Revolt is a cut above its brethren and one that you should give some time to.,1
151658," Whether or not events actually unfolded this way, the story the film tells is an interesting and complicated character study, with something to say about the corrosive effects of power and privilege on both the innocent and the guilty.",1
97098," While Emily Blunt tries her best, the original sets far too high a standard for Mary Poppins Returns to hope to achieve.",0

207973," As Patti spits out her lyrics - lewd, incendiary and eventually empowering - writer-director Jasper announces his own arrival with a great deal of swagger.",1
173192," Despite flashes of bawdy humor, Can't Hardly Wait is just like its beer: it starts out frothy but soon goes flat.",0
241145," A slow-building shiver of a movie, ""The Little Stranger"" tells a familiar but pleasurably engrossing story.",1
152068," Thanks especially to the Gainsbourg and her character, the film ends up being something almost implausible: a literary biopic that is worthwhile. [Full review in Spanish]",1
227841, I might almost sit through the crappy storytelling one more time just to see the car chases. These are the kind car chases that Stuntman Mike from Death Proof might be able to appreciate,0
116692," No doubt, this darkly humorous metaphysical comedy would have had more impact if it were made before Jonze, Kaufman and Gondry created their surreal works, but it's still an impressive debut, skillfully acted and directed.",1
219218," In short, this is good subversive kids stuff in the tradition of Joe Dante and Tim Burton, championing freaks and youthful underdogs while portraying adults, especially those in authority, as corrupt, foolish, or deranged.",1
93214, The film follows the expected path toward Spielbergian contentment for young and old alike.,1
127500," One of those sadly dependent independent films, every bit as formulaic as any Hollywood blockbuster.",0
151753," It seems to be going in interesting directions, scrupulously building up elements of mystery, horror, philosophical pondering, character study, and psychological thriller. But like so many modern multi-taskers,...it never quite does any one thing well.",0
77392," Super plunges into nihilistic despair in its third act. This isn't a black comedy because it isn't a comedy. It's a trick played on our expectations, I concede, but to what end?",0
42843," An absolute blast, with a never-sexier Theron in some of the best action scenes to hit a screen.",1
111754, It's the kind of vaguely philosophical travelogue/not-exactly-love story audiences are virtually guaranteed to find either exotically fascinating or utterly interminable.,0
42349," William Friedkin revisits his Exorcist franchise with a curious companion piece for fans, which throws up more questions than it answers.",1
15067," Lurching woozily between daytimesoap psychodrama and a brainless, claws-out, pseudo-feminist slasher flick, Obsessed is one boiled rabbit away from bad-film nirvana.",0
32636, Once you adjust to the exuberant theatricality and goofy comedy it does start to grow on you.,1
129271," Genius is an over-used and therefore devalued word, but Inside Out is what it looks like.",1
64716, Only a human vegetable could have possibly viewed the final cut and not have had any vocal concerns about the submerged level of quality on display.,0
216170," Shyamalan takes the beloved source material, strips the characters of all emotion, throws in intrusive narration, douses it in CGI and tries to pass it off as a viable effort.",0
208745," The Safety of Objects doesn't expose nearly enough of the pre-traumatic to make before distinguishable from after. So the film leaves you dissatisfied, as though you'd just spent two hours with a menagerie of plastic white people.",0
79840," With its occasional forays into alternate realities and dreamy, keyed-up atmosphere, La La Land plays sort of like a cheerful Mulholland Dr., but shares none of that movie's cynicism.",1
60565," The relative success of Split seems to have given Shyamalan license to create another indulgent, sloppy tantrum of a film.",0
131610, The post-Katniss Everdeen teen dystopia seems doomed to repeat the same (and increasingly less effective) formula forever. [Full review in Spanish],0

115972," After a mostly quiet film, tension kicks into high gear in the third act, but it ultimately raises more questions than it answers.",0
25983," With flashy fight choreography and on-the-nose performances from an all-star cast, John Wick delivers a solid action flick experience worthy of Keanu's pedigree in the genre.",1
162482," It isn't a particularly great Woody Allen movie. Nor is it a particularly disappointing one. It falls into the vast middle ground on his resume -- the movies you enjoy sitting through, but quickly forget once the lights come up.",1
20390," As visual spectacle, Avatar is indelible, but as a movie it all but evaporates as you watch it.",1
26179, This is no Titus ... and no Forbidden Planet either. ,0

72214," Not only does Human Flow succeed in its awareness-raising quest, but it also becomes exactly what Ai is best known for: a visually striking piece of art that contemplates a vital subject.",1
80526, The Mummy is the perfect movie if you love mindless big-budget special effects extravaganzas but absolutely hate having fun.,0
220116," Rogen continues to toke bongs and crack jokes about dongs, all in an increasingly desperate attempt to extend immaturity into infinity. Maybe it's just me, but having initially been a fan I've grown weary of his pot fueled antics.",0
103635, It bites off much more than it can chew but deserves credit for doing something different and for the verve with which it goes about that.,0
204004," [It's]a harrowing adventure behind the headlines that is at once a riveting procedural and, at the same time, a bracing political statement on the moral ambiguities of our war on terror.",1
47250," 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days unspools as dispassionately as a security camera video. There are no judgments rendered here, only truths that arise from harrowing insights.",1
32764," It's a bit of a bounce back for Shyamalan, who's reconnecting with what worked in ""The Sixth Sense.""",0
233910," An engrossing, real world epic love story.",1
247328," It's like a pastiche of a '70's Sidney Lumet picture: well made, well performed but lacking the bite and shrewd intelligence of the older movies it reminds you of. In this way it's a better movie about modern American filmmaking than the era it recreates.",1
161021, There's a lot of noise and blurry action in 'Darkness Falls' -- like the start of my worst migraines.,0
50571," Never preaching, Rosi leaves it for us to soak up these revelations. The result is sometimes wayward but peppered with images that sear the brain.",1

49858," Although magnificent and filled with imagination, Fantasia 2000 doesn't hold up as being particularly ground-breaking or innovative.",1
98886," It's a Frozen-meets-Hunger Games-meets-X-Men rip-off, but I'm prepared to cut it some slack because it contains a truly novel character: a cool female dwarf.",0
35769," The phrase ""lump of coal"" comes to mind after watching The Dark Tower, a lavish and most definitely lackluster CliffsNotes abridgment of a CliffsNotes adaptation of the Stephen King science fiction-fantasy-western magnum opus. ",0
137755, It's enough to send fans and converts alike to the Cohen library for more of the master himself.,1
146062," ...just an impersonal Saturday-night revenge flick, of the sort that Michael Haneke's Funny Games (either version) eviscerated and made irrelevant.",0
221527, It Comes at Night is a masterful work of spooky suspense. Writer-director Trey Edward Shults has created a claustrophobic gem of a movie.,1
65703," There just isn't enough in the movie, despite its marvelous design, to warrant another visit to this material.",0
158309," It's all amusing and loopy, while also insincere and unfocused. The film mocks rigid militarism and faddish alternative movements both, but it offers few fresh observations about either.",0
7628," If Jarmusch has a goal with Gimme Danger beyond putting the history of The Stooges on film, it's to create the feeling of hanging out with Iggy on a nice afternoon while he tells stories for hours.",1
113191, A very odd black comedy.,1
32249," Surrounded by a solid supporting cast and making the most of a few memorable lines, Whittaker's skills help lift what would otherwise be just a solid, unspectacular drama.",1
211641," Scrapping many of the undead cliches and aided by troublingly realistic special effects, Slade has crafted one hell of a monster movie.",1
234620," Ends up, ironically, burying the lead beneath underdeveloped subplots and characters as well as a final act that seemed desperate to wrap itself up to meet its own deadline.",0
42209," Jordan Peele's highly entertaining -albeit, a bit muddled- follow-up to Get Out, gives us, not one, but two of Lupita Nyong'o's best performances in (incredibly) her first leading role. ",1

15432," As a phenomenon, Twilight still takes some beating, but in the end Eclipse, while certainly servicing the fans, should perhaps have given them more than a stop-gap until next-year's two-part finale.",0
249925," Bateman is already a star pupil of comedy, and he could earn an honor's diploma in filmmaking if he learns to spell singularity.",1

55050," Your Sister's Sister gets it just right, aided by Vince Smith's string--accented musical score and Benjamin Kasulke's luscious cinematography.",1
94962," Everything that takes place feels so deliberately orchestrated that the seeming meaninglessness of certain actions become charged with, er, ""meaning.""",1
175790," ""The Flowers of War"" seems like a pretty good film until you begin to think about it.",0
13130, The Carer actually turns out to be better than most iterations of this hoary old set-up. It is all because there is some lasting fizz to the two effervescent lead performances on display here.,1
120169, It's good. But not great.,1
108904," Weak Halloween entry. Maintains the status quo, no new developments.",0

236916," In the annals of Noel films so wincingly, gratingly, insultingly bad that a lump of coal would be vastly preferable, The Perfect Holiday ranks alongside Surviving Christmas for sheer unwatchability.",0
88349, This dull trifle forced me to co-opt the names Sleepy and Grumpy for the duration of its running time.,0
34154," The film doesn't live; it merely exists, content to keep our eyeballs occupied without investing any more than is absolutely necessary.",0
5394," It's really just a solid courtroom drama, but these days moviegoers should take what they can get.",1
51339," This Canadian feature cleverly mixes archetypes from war films and coming-of-age movies, defamiliarizing both genres in the process.",1
192850," Jaws... has nothing on this thing, which features up-close underwater photography of a school of sharks brushing up against our hapless divers' legs.",1

188465," It is, or should have been, an elegy for something, but the film doesn't do the loving and detailed historical work of showing us what it's an elegy for. It's too busy shoving Marxist dirt on the West Village's grave.",0
247153," Director János Szász's sense of atmosphere is suitably chilling, but that's undermined by a lack of focus and broad-stroke portrayals.",0
108496, In Your Hands' terrific performances can't entirely justify 80 minutes of slow deliberation.,0
101215, ...a unique film and a real time capsule of the 1990s when movie geeks hung out at video stores.,1
42969," ""Montage of Heck"" doesn't shock us with any new revelations, but it goes deep - sometimes, uncomfortably so - inside Cobain's messy, restlessly creative, emotionally complex soul.",1
181073," The animation isn't particularly sophisticated, but the ideas certainly are.",1
223935," The visuals of A Cat in Paris resonate in any language, and it doesn't hurt that the picture features a stunning, stealthy Bernard Hermann-style orchestral score by Serge Bessett.",1
123956," A solid whodunit, with disturbing, provocative, take-home insights into human nature.",1
67157," Make no mistake about it, Holy Motors is a film that makes no sense at all. Yet like the most beautiful, twisted and irrelevant of dreams it is a movie that will stay in your head and create dreamscapes of its own.",1
152151," This is, in effect, the second half of the film, and if Reloaded was mostly build-up, Revolutions is all payoff. ",1
32674, The film covers the history of the central events as well as could be hoped in an hour and 40 minutes and conveys some of the feel of the time.,1
73059," As a standalone film, it delivers intense and engaging action. Though, I couldn't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by the final battle sequence we have waited ten years to see.",1
154376," On paper, the story is extraordinary. By way of Stewart's execution, it's far from that.",0
72514," It's supposed to be upsetting, and it is, but that doesn't make it any more watchable.",0
199543," Adolescent girls (and boys, too) are entitled to teen-tragedy tear-jerkers, those Kleenex-soaking tales of the fragility of life and love in an uncaring universe. But that audience deserves better than Midnight Sun.",0
76528," Not every movie is, or has to be, an Event. Sometimes all I ask of a film is that it offer a pleasant diversion for an hour and a half. That's exactly what I got from 'Peace, Love, & Misunderstanding'.",1
237004," Avoids... any concession to cheap sentimentality, despite the fact that the story has many dramatic ingredients. [Full review in Spanish]",1
39223, One of the indie gems of 2011.,1
43178," ""We Came Home"" has its amateurish side, but it's effortlessly affecting when showing how music acts as an extended hand across generations and cultures. ",1
65221," Usually those annoying 3D glasses are worth neither the hassle nor the surcharge, but in this case they saved my two children from noticing their normally stoic father blubbering like a newborn baby. ",1
118131," As for the serious fans of his work, well, maybe I'm not getting something, but they seem like the craziest people in the movie.",0
164654, A superior story.,1
189434, [Mikkelsen] is one of the most enigmatic actors working today. But the cinematic scaffolding around him is so rickety that it's hard to ever really sink in and enjoy his handiwork before his spell is broken by some inane slapstick comedy.,0
22249, A strong first act that is opaqued by confusion and tediousness till the end. [Full Review in Spanish],0
34935," Aja...apparently thinks that metaphysical speculation is for wimps; his audience wants red meat, and he's going to give it them, no matter how inappropriate it is.",0
146260, The scares are nicely handled early on and director David F Sandberg breathes new life into hoary horror tropes. But the movie loses puff after an hour when it decides to show us the monster.,1
237676, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a taut psychological thriller with superb performances from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman. The measured reveal of the mysterious plot establishes a palpable tension throughout. ,1
181504," Farmiga matches Clooney's rhythms perfectly, and watching these two glossy creatures circle and parry is one of the great cinematic pleasures of the year.",1
220221," J. Edgar is a love story. The fact that one of the lovers is someone you wouldn't want at your dinner table means that the film is handsome, well crafted, but not nearly as involving as it might have been.",1
95703, One of the most challenging and visually accomplished films of Almodóvar's long career.,1
218962, Was something lost in translation or was the source material not as strong as book sales would have us believe?,0
25748," Zoe Kazan wrote herself a doozy of a part. She's the title character in Ruby Sparks, a film that superficially appears to be a romantic comedy but whose disturbing undertones guarantee that it will never be mistaken for some Katherine Heigl stinkbomb.",1
226520," Working on an obviously limited budget on locations in Savannah, Ga., Redford does a good job of evoking the era with the help of cinematographer Newton Thomas Siegel.",1
165226, Manages to snatch all the fun out of calling every big moment by being so by the book it ignores important elements...like chemistry and a sensible plot.,0
182340," Just My Luck is a deserted wasteland when it comes to funny. It's also boring, plain and simple.",0
17386," It took 40 years, but Robert De Niro finally has made a movie that enables him to utter this line: ""Rambo the skateboard pimp was my tenth kill.""",0
207388," Full of violence and blood-spattered gunplay, it's a visually grotty film buoyed mainly by Gibson's never-say-die performance.",0
200814," At no point does the empowering gender switch compromise the movie's speed demon action and pyrotechnics, which are a refreshing return to operatic thrills after all the same-old CGI shenanigans we've become numb to.",1
118608, A whimsical hand-drawn animation concerned with the woes of consumerism that wonderfully embraces the mischievous spirit of its eccentric Finnish creator.,1
241714," A beautiful, messy film: at times lyrical, intimate, and uplifting; at others, vast, inscrutable, and maddening.",1
190396," Begins with an exciting, superbly crafted heist sequence that recalls Michael Mann's Heat, setting up expectations that the rest of the movie mostly fails to meet.",1
18575," It's fun to see the stooped but still charismatic star playing a roguish old coot, but...several off notes suggest its director is as out of touch as the man he depicts.",0
62446," In Aloha, Crowe's fabled generosity toward his characters and actors becomes special pleading.",0
202933," Vikander's tomb-raider-to-be takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin', using her wits, her wiles and what she's made of herself to slice through this B-movie obstacle course. ",1
51161," It's a disappointment too that Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, who found such rhythm and bite in recent outings such as ""Let the Right One In"" (2008) and ""Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy"" (2011), seems so hobbled here.",0
63602," Here's what's truly infuriating-the fact that the beloved young-adult novel of which the film is based fell into the hands of the ""Hostel"" series horror-famed director Eli Roth.",0
133999," ""The Tainted Veil"" resists taking a stance, and both sides of the argument are compelling and persuasive.",1

6393," Hugely engaging, as well as important and inspiring.",1
35858, This is an almost apocalyptic tale of thwarted emotion - love cut short - set in a pitiless land of delusions.,1
89123, Here's what I can say for sure about the humanoid attackers in the new version of The Crazies: They're not very interesting.,0
79110," After two hours of stilted dialogue (delivered by usually reliable performers who here seem totally at sea) and lush photography, your average viewer will have been massaged into a near-comatose state.",0
31865," While the idea's neat, there's no attempt to explore the weighty implications. It's a likeably quirky movie, mind, with Giamatti's hangdog features meaning a smile's never too far from your lips.",1
212393, An inspiring story of compassion and service in a program training rape victims to be community leaders. ,1
229618, The Hunter is too many films in one...,0
154726, Great opening shot that leads to an action flick that's all wet.,1
126139," A typical Oscars movie. Solid, middle-brow and worthy.",1
39803," Wu's mostly glass-eyed filmic observations also allow Desire to remain safely in shallow waters, never truly interrogating its subjects in a way that could lead to revelation. ",0
186849, There are more than a few moments that hint at the fantasy classic this might have been. See it in 2D.,1
188111," The movie's all set-up and no payoff, merely a placeholder until the series' next cash cow moos into theaters.",0
210673, Lovers of blood sport action ... are going to enjoy the well-staged fighting sequences ... while tender hearts seeking emotional depth will find the father-son conflict reasonably engaging.,1
178793," From the texture of the underground havens to the idea that our leads have to - literally - cling to each other lest gravity tears them apart, it's a wonder of detail and ingenuity.",1
2448, Besson's labour of love is a feast for the eyes but leaves the imagination distinctly undernourished.,0
103032," Battle-scene overkill aside, there's no denying the eye-popping majesty of Jackson's epic spectacle.",1
56226," His fortitude under critical flak is admirable, and his self-confidence unbelievable, but RocknRolla is the same old shaggy-dog story with a slightly different variety fleas.",0
66075," It provides food for thought, but perhaps we're just tired of the same old food. Go the whole hog; give me a happy meal instead.",0
28209, This is the view from the end of the world -- we look on the smoking ruin of Manhattan and shrug and eat our popcorn.,0
225992," The fourth chapter of the Indiana Jones chronicles feels repetitive and a little gassed, but it has too much bravura filmmaking, and just enough wit, to not recommend.",1
191918," I encourage anyone who has the opportunity to see The Dark Knight in the IMAX format, DO! It's impressive beyond imagination.",1
95746, It's a relief then that writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio have fun with the belief that all humor doesn't have to be of the wink-nudge variety to appeal to adults in the 'plex.,1
185764," Leo and Upham make an unlikely double act in a finely written, well-played film with a striking plot and setting. Hunt's clearly a name to watch; Leo, meanwhile, can look forward to finally getting the recognition, and roles, she deserves.",1
142984," Point a camera at actress Marion Cotillard for the duration of a feature drama and remarkable things are bound to happen, especially with such an engaging script by Belgian filmmakers the Dardenne brothers.",1
217165," One can only hope that in the future [Reeves] will devote himself to playing androids, less-self-aware species of undead, stylish pieces of contemporary furniture, and other roles that do not require the exhibition of any recognizably human traits.",0
186239," [The story] gets constantly literally swamped by the blood and gore and so forth, which is well done but almost to the point of parody. ",0
92483," As a popcorn movie, this is a full bucket.",1
199383," Slow and earnest, with dreamy, sleep-inducing music, it proves to be a remarkably inconsequential film even if it does possess a few dramatic moments.",0
92277, Dinner for Schmucks belongs to that mangy breed of American comedy that confuses situations that are genuinely funny for situations that are agonisingly awkward.,0
80900," David Frost wasn't Richard Nixon's foe so much as that camera's red light, which Ron Howard films as futuristic, robotic and destructive from Nixon's vantage point. What audiences deduce from one shot can imprint how an entire era is interpreted.",1
159084," ""Source Code"" is perfectly enjoyable as a swiftly moving thriller, and Gyllenhaal is effective as a mystified fellow who eventually engages himself - and us - in putting the pieces of the puzzle together.",1
232242," A sweet and quirky love story with shades of Groundhog Day and Big that subtly touches on identity, personality, and love being more than skin deep.",1

174983, David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have successfully pared the unwieldy book down into something that works well enough that this film places third in my personal best of Potter movies list.,1

197440," Director Roger Kumble began his big-screen career with a clever Dangerous Liaisons set in high school, Cruel Intentions, and worked his way down to College Road Trip and now this.",0
87217," Needing to fill an extra 85 minutes, the filmmakers clumsily explore the characters' therapeutic needs.",0
195091," With gorgeous cinematography by Caroline Champetier and memorably unsentimental performances... Fontaine's film is neither anti-religion nor pro-science but, instead, about compassion, mercy and forgivenes.",1
156947, These wellworn devices might have been more effective had Derrickson managed to link them to a compelling central idea.,0
104350, ...one can't help but wonder if there's anything of interest left to say within this increasingly stale genre.,0
137937, Like Big Trouble in Little China without the laughs.,0
217913," Basically, there's just too much crammed into ""Marigold Hotel"" for any of it to have impact. It may work as comfort food for old folks, but a bit less may have yielded a great deal more.",0
163043, Moore gives a controlled portrait of emotional implosion ...,1
143964, TGOTT goes nowhere slowly. At least Gone Girl was trashy fun.,0
48880, This one is commercial cinema done just about right.,1
14519," A comprehensively entertaining package. If there's a lack of originality, the film is bolstered by the sheer verve of the animation and effects.",1
64375," If the film survives the poxes and put-downs from fans, it will be due, in no small part, to the breezy charms of actor Alden Ehrenreich as Ethan. He has the looks of mid-1950s Tony Curtis and a goofy affability.",1
41687," Pixar's latest release is brilliantly animated, and a lot of fun. But it does not have a clear sense of who its audience is, and families with children who are looking for the next Finding Nemo may find themselves puzzled.",1
82858," Vin Diesel can't compensate for the bad dialogue, formulaic plotting, and gradually diminishing interest of each race/chase scene.",0
42265," None of the character of, say, a Will Ferrell movie, or the cyncial wit of Harold and Kumar.",0
128695," A big ol' mess of atrocious acting and terrible scripting, The Last Airbender is a definite nominee for worst film of 2010. ",0
201188," Silly, ridiculous, violent and worthy.",1
178812," It's high time MLK got the big-screen platform he deserves. Thanks to Selma, justice has been done.",1
156725," A loose adaptation of The Little Mermaid that's full of fantastic visuals and genuine whimsy, but a little lax when it comes to plot logic or meaningful themes.",1
246284," Even if it doesn't necessarily hold together as a coherent narrative and its mystery only makes a little sense, Kiss Kiss is a tremendously entertaining trip.",1
212573," It delivers laughs, spirit, energy, and shows us that anything is possible through faith, trust, and, of course, a little pixie dust.",1
120523, Begins with an outrageous concept and takes it to the -- pun definitely intended -- max.,1
86997," While War for the Planet of the Apes's third act is a bit hairy, the sequel helps cement the franchise as one of the more exciting mainstream properties worth watching.",1
164885, A scenario ripped straight from a screenwriting computer program.,0
70324," A strongly acted, handsomely crafted film that nonetheless feels bland and unsatisfying.",0
217116," The film is interested in a cult of personality. Like Anderson's previous movie, ""The Master"" is a portrait of megalomania.",1
62301," ... the dialogue in ""Lady Bird"" is consistently and honestly funny and cliché-free.",1
115803," A deliciously dark horror-thriller that brims with twists, turns and sneaky secrets and manages to spin the horror genre on its head to really deliver some smart chills.",1
139332," If the principal audience for ""Conan O'Brien Can't Stop"" is obviously the comedian's legions of fans, it's probably most interesting as a detached study of the workings of fame.",1
71750," For the record, Rachman's punk-rockology has its cracks. While he worships at the altar of Henry Rollins and Black Flag, he excludes such key West Coast bands as X and the Dead Kennedys.",0
49865," Parker is best at nurturing a simmering tension throughout the narrative, where the safety of Turner and his family is ever-precarious.",1
204680," Hopefully the inevitable sequel will tell a better story and not rely so heavily on the goodwill of having a female kicking, punching and stabbing the bad guys.",1
211116, A straight-ahead political thriller that fails to ratchet up the requisite tension despite its timely subject matter and (largely) effective cast.,0
246951, ...About as entertaining as avian flu.,0
216160," Costner, in full badass mode, makes this crackpot premise work.",1
224728, My biggest surprise is scanning the credits and not seeing the name Wayans or Prinze Jr. anywhere.,0
67108, A kind of DayGlo-colored time capsule that tantalizes.,1
163211," This movie, a testament to the power of seeing, provides a long and uncommonly vivid look at a human crisis that's changing the face of our planet.",1
83881," The movie is subtle, full of quiet power, and showcases finely crafted performances from all but one of its key players (Nick Kroll).",1
144731," The long-awaited superhero supergroup is finally assembled, and their film does not disappoint. It's a smashmouth extravaganza of outsized proportions.",1
212780," The are many things that I don't want to come back, such as the Black Death, volcanic dust clouds and J-Lo rom-coms.",0
145192, I think it's a galling.,0
241420, a solid piece of entertainment,1
68170, This is a freaky thing to behold: Knightley's wildly physical rendering of a mentally unbalanced soul.,1
176681, Denzel Washington is the man.,1
158103," It turned a fairly basic game into a perfectly serviceable action film, and then it leveled itself up by making a game about destruction into a movie about cooperation.",1
146904," Spectacular but also emotionally affecting, it's a fitting capstone to a series that remains unmatched, despite many attempts over the past decade to imitate its magical formula.",1
18965," The piece works best as an audio-video experience, uniquely tying together its period piece trappings with a wonderful soundtrack.",0
10106," It gets into survival mode pretty quick, and turns out that the misfits, the delinquents, the non-conformists in society are those that handle this situation best. I hope they complete this trilogy.",1
101054," ""Joy"" is a fascinating journey celebrating the American dream while making compelling comments on feminism, capitalism and the long-suffering love of family.",1
77430," The art-heist plot is pretty by-the-numbers, but Travolta nearly saves it with his doomed air of paternal helplessness.",0
170695," Peter's 'dark' night is a lot more fun than a certain Dark Knight, and indicative of a comic-book franchise that never loses its mission to engage and enthrall.",1
46717," Ellroy, who also co-wrote the screenplay, and Ayer share an interest in L.A. after dark, and they explore the city's neon-bathed streets with the glee of children in a funhouse, watching the distortions of everyday people in bent mirrors.",1
49701," There's a lot more to Nowhere in Africa -- too much, actually ... Yet even if the movie has at least one act too many, the question that runs through it -- of whether belonging to a place is a matter of time or of will -- remains consistent.",1
150215," Given such rich material, the cast unsurprisingly flourishes and excels.",1
13538," What makes the doc watchable, of course, are the musical sequences, whether he's playing Tchaikovsky, Bach or Williams.",1
178299," With a joke well that runs dry nearly an hour too early, watches will be checked and previously unwanted popcorn kernels will be rigorously examined.",0
74868, Pleasantly forgettable.,1
128087," The actors seem lost in a gumball dispenser; the audience, for the most part, might well feel the same way.",0
167081, As the heroes rush from one set-piece to the next battling monsters and shooting bullets there's little tension or gravitas attached to their journey.,0
64894," A serious, schematic, well-acted film about adjusting to new lifestyles in a changing world...",1
26792," Perhaps it is simply an accident of timing that puts Milk in theaters at this moment. But fate or simple fortunate timing, Milk arrives as one of the best films of 2008.",1
248842," While it is no classic, it is a thoroughly engaging, provocative and funny film, especially true if you like sardonic humour.",1
206283," There is a lot to like about Game of Death - the gore, the premise, the opening scenes - but Landry and Morais-Lagace's project is undermined by poor pacing, bland narrative arcs and a lack of conflict.",0
21163," Little more than a carnival of oddities, and as we have come to expect from Burton in recent years, a further example of style over substance.",0
132291," Michelle Williams, who doesn't particularly look like Monroe, is so successful channeling her in a luminous, brilliant performance that one forgets one's watching another actress.",1
63359," Most scenes play too long, with a surplus of ideas, textures, tones and characters, and after 134 minutes it's clear Lee's problem with closure hasn't gone away.",0
89715, Routine biopic of legendary American composer Cole Porter.,0
136693, Miss Kiet's Children is far more than an extraordinary feat in documentary filmmaking - it's uncontaminated observation. [Full Review in Spanish],1
196536," Portraying the most encrusted cat-lady of them all, Dench sinks her fangs into the spinster role, brandishing Marber's dialogue like a lethal weapon; she's Selma Bouvier with a sniper's rifle for a tongue.",1
104552, Humor is as obvious as the fact that Brett Ratner and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson watched every single Bruce Lee and John Woo movie before making this.,0
172636," The confluence of events allows the film to arrive somewhere that may not be original, but feels honest...at other times, the film seems to be chasing the same old indie dragon of quirky escapades that can be shot on the cheap.",0

232224, I think it's very ordinary.,0
68981," How, exactly, do you make us feel sympathy for the devil?",0
119608," Rich Hill is poverty porn, examining lower-class spaces with pity as its operative mode and engendering little more than a means for viewers to leave the film acknowledging its sadness.",0
160235," Though a decidedly minimalist action picture, Arctic achieves maximum impact thanks to Mikkelsen's rugged, yet tender portrayal of a man whose only choice is to chill, or be chilled.",1
30778, Showalter tackles his mission with energy and an upbeat attitude that makes him a winner as a lovable loser.,1
30759," Quillévéré views everything and everyone with such tender-hearted compassion that it builds into an elegantly handled, deeply felt drama.",1

251430," By the time blood flows and heads roll -- literally -- Tenants has already slipped and slid into the land of caricatures, offering comedy where it shouldn't.",0
72763, Wow. This is what comic purgatory must look like. ,0

234685," By the time it comes to an end, Frantz has made a permanent imprint, the hope for a better tomorrow after a cataclysmic yesterday striking chords of promise that make even the harshest of injuries feel as if they someday can be healed.",1
125792," What the Surrealists found in Louis Feuillade's World War I serials, we can find here. [Jacques] Rivette too renders the ordinary dreamlike by filming his fantasy-driven actors in the midst of life.",1
58078, When it's working there's plenty to admire but when it falters the film stumbles badly.,1
12577," It's a mass-appeal crowd-pleaser augmented by a topical immediacy, and director Peter Farrelly (There's Something About Mary, Shallow Hal) has done a fine service to his best material in years. ",1
86022," Like Lara herself, there is a tremendous amount of potential here that is never fully realized. Maybe the next tomb will be a bit deeper.",0

250513," This is a fascinating portrait of a unique character who has built his own world out the worlds of others. Quite unlike poseur photographers, he dresses, eats sleeps and talks simply; he gets around on a push bike. And he smiles a lot",1

241807, Works reasonably well in its Hollywoodized way. ,1
187498," Kenneth Branagh takes on both the famous detective and the role of director, but thankfully excels at both. His Poirot is sharp, funny and just eccentric enough.",1

158891," Did I ever have fun at ""Roll Bounce!""",1
195168, The story is more dignified and tonally consistent than in the last film...but much of it plays out with just as little weight as Fantastic Beasts' silliest moments.,0

232209, Isn't nearly as fun and frothy as it wants to be.,0
34130," The casting's pretty fair, and if they had better material, Steve Zahn and Rachael Harris would have been real assets. But the story lurches from indignity to ill-starred wrestling match to gross-out gag, without any momentum or surprise.",0
177369," Devoid of a point of view, a narrative structure, intelligent dialogue and three-dimensional (or even two-dimensional) characters, the latest Batman movie is much more like a violence-oriented video game than a form of dramatic art.",0
45405," It's Crossing Over -- or as we call it at my desk, Crash: Special Victims Unit.",0
15413," Once again, as in the first two movies, there is a lot of talk about sex and a lot of attempts to have sex, but the sex that actually occurs is almost entirely respectful, monogamous, and really quite sweet.",1
155924," Longer, louder, stupider and more vulgar than 1995's Bad Boys.",0
204104," There is resolution in the end of After the Storm, though Kore-eda doesn't wrap things up too neatly. He's trying to capture life, and he shows us with gentle humanity that life is usually messy.",1
41366," a blow-to-the-crotch, boobie-shot kind of comedy",0
12528," Kedarnath is a pointless, entirely forgettable film, but some may remember the girl fondly - which may well be the film's only task.",0
180955, Such a massive improvement over its predecessor that it may cause whiplash,1
94105," I was on cloud nine throughout the film: that place of Technicolored rapture where Kaurismäki fans dwell, and where past, present and oneiric future are rolled celestially into one.",1
3491, A film lacking charm that tries to do what many have done before it and try to make humor out of the cliches of princesses. [Full Review in Spanish],0
250999," ...two hours of brutality, excrement and viscera. Yes, some segments disturb and repel, and many try for dark humor, but the squirms they induce are far from pleasurable.",0
11943," ""Suburbicon,"" a film that, despite checking a lot of the right boxes, simply isn't very good.",0
121348," The comedy is hit and miss, with good bits interrupted by dead patches.",0

40091, The new Fright Night lacks charm and depth. It's strictly for subscribers of Fangoria magazine in that it commits to its R rating and gives gore hounds a lot to sink their teeth into. (Content Review for Parents also available),0
198178, Lemon doesn't take the easy road in any aspect of its being. It's a confrontational film willing to put the audience in a series of uncomfortable situations that only grow with each passing moment.,1

220615," Nearly as much a movie advocating a belief in Santa Claus as a belief in the real existence of CGI animated characters, the film is at once mystifying and uninvolving.",1
131516," Ambitious, but mistimed.",0
144131," This movie is afraid of making too much fun of its subject for this and other reasons, and that unfortunately keeps the movie from joining that great tradition of films that pay tribute to the cracked nobility of making bad art.",0

35730," Overall, despite the abundance of cobwebs and dust in the Havisham mansion, this adaption has a glossy, superficial feel to it. More grit, texture and emotion are what's needed to really bring this story to life.",0

134900," The stop-motion animation is calculated to resemble and recall a long-ago fairy tale, and it does that well, but the convoluted yet simplistic story of an orphan boy raised by box-wearing, underground-dwelling trolls falls flat almost from the beginning",0
60823," The basis is classic mystery, yes, and that should be respected, but Ozon is using the form to arrive at a much deeper character study in a manner that is almost Polanski-esque.",1
145319, Avant-garde action cinema on an enormous scale that manages to be utterly original and suffused with a rebellion against patriarchy that is thrilling to watch in this form.,1

82242, Nolan is a well-appointed mainstream fabulist who uses a great deal of money and technology to no great artistic purpose. ,0

104367, 'School of Rock' with swords.,1
224744," If an expert presentation is enough for you to forgive the utter absurdity of the melodramatic plot, assume your seat in the courtroom; otherwise, take the usual evasive action to avoid jury duty.",0
46855, Sporadically poetic but largely a chore to sit through.,0
19796," By its final reel, Carpignano's film seems more interested in giving a voice to a bereaved culture than giving it hope, and hope is not going to be the feeling audiences take from the theater.",0
58121," Faux-doc or not, Burstein's film is funny and engaging, and it gives us an amazing intimacy and identification with these characters as it skillfully strips away the layers of their cliched teenage stereotypes to reveal the true person beneath.",1
61923," Son of Rambow maintains just the right tone throughout with its guileless, makeshift charm.",1
228954, It's going to leave fans of the series frustrated and everybody else completely baffled.,0
209960," As with last year's The Void, Mohawk is wonderfully long on setting, mood, and practical effects, and woefully short on storytelling and drama.",0
20027, Fans of the original fishy tale will be delighted to learn that the sequel has most definitely been worth the wait. ,1
236671," The end result, however, is a skewed picture that manages to promote Hollywood-style derring-do and make fascism look more stylish and profound than it has done in years.",1
149309, Displays the kind of poise and confidence that can only happen when you're following on from a critical smash that also became one of the most successful movies of all time.,1
136442," At 90 minutes, it felt entirely too long, but would I have wanted Jarmusch to trim it down at all? That would have killed his best jokes.",1
20621, Sure its soapy and saccharine but that is exactly what Nicholas Sparks' fans want,0
225717," You haven't seen women like this before. Cruel, distant, unfriendly, and selfish. Provocative and daring in its unsentimental approach to real life problems. ",1
174833," Gods and monsters be damned, Thor is still the same old origin story, indistinguishable from the dozens we've seen in summers past.",0
247951," It tries a little too hard to be charming, and when mixed with abysmal attempts at Scottish accents that almost seem facetious, the entire production comes off as inauthentic and a bit of a joke.",0
141571, Writer-director Louise Archambault's neatly affirmative denouement is at odds with the more uncertain reality occurring at the edges of the film's drama.,0
151291," McQuarrie's entire roster strains the limits of character likability to the breaking point, and no amount of plot twists, double-crosses, or hidden alliances can help us relate to or even tolerate anyone on screen.",0
246964," It's demented, occasionally inspired, and often very funny.",1
59553," A dedicated work in the extra lacerating sound of bullets, explosions, torpedoes and music almost without a break. [Full review in Spanish]",1
138248, This period drama about Django Reinhardt will please fans of his music while dismaying those looking for concrete facts about the life of the a Belgium-born French jazz guitarist of Romani decent.,1
101710," Technically, the film is a comedy/drama, but the overall vibe of Prince Avalanche is elegiac and reflective.",1

116593," Mary Queen of Scots is an alternate history that takes ruling out of the throne room and settles the fate of Britain in carefully worded letters, portraits and calculating gestures of friendship, set in the confines of spaces associated with women.",1
10036," When you're not shaking your head at plot inconsistencies, poorly drawn characters and lamentable dialogue, you'll no doubt feel let down that such a brilliant action actress made her return to the genre in such a lemon.",0
148609, It is a shame the material lets [the cast] -- and the audience -- down at the very end.,0
6188," Square in the middle of the series, quality-wise: though the new film has some unabashedly dumb moments, its plot lacks the pathetic contortions that we saw in Saw IV",0
48090," ""Song to Song"" tests its dreamers and wanderers and leaves them a little wiser, maybe, for the experience. And maybe that's the best way to express how I felt watching it ...",1

113399, The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing.,0
208624, Separately the characters are annoying; together it's unnervingly like watching one actress playing twins.,0
97896," The missteps don't detract from the thrilling brilliance of the filmmaking (aided by the remarkable cinematographer Ed Lachman), or dim the sense that Haynes was right in deciding that the fractions of the man would add up to more than the man himself.",1
174957," There's truth in the central relationship metaphor of looking after the family garden ""before the winter chill"", but it's scant cinematic recompense for the weed patch where events culminate.",0

140394," This Husband tries desperately to squeeze itself into the trim style of other bustle and bonnet faves, but it's a bad fit.",0
77202," Affleck has a deft hand, keeping the pace quick and handling both his actors and drama with skill. It's clear that Gone Baby Gone was no fluke. ",1
98001," Some consider The Passenger a classic, which leads me to believe there are also people who enjoy waiting for trains that will probably never arrive.",0
170950, A humane and absorbing big-city film.,1

9809, Movies about exotic travel tend to reduce locals to unknowable Others. 'Embrace of the Serpent' doesn't want to do that.,1

92383," Sunshine has a more ethereal look than the average science fiction movie but, considering the subject matter, it works.",1
10222," [Hold the Dark] strives to depict, with unflinching sincerity, the imbalance and upset in the natural order that arises from the murder of innocents. It's harrowing, but strangely beautiful too.",1
167965," Raw and emotionally truthful...an intriguing two-hander (mostly), about the dangers of temptation and the freedom of monogamy.",1
116496," Stiller's sequel lazily swaps out satire for celebrity cameos, memorable musical cues for different iterations of the same songs, and a childlike Derek for a cruel one.",0

159550," There's a pleasantly low-fi, bare-bones kind of storytelling here, at least before the movie's mysteries are boringly explained - another apocalypse to parse.",0
25034," Based on a true story, this modest tale of doomed German resistance -- something we don't hear a lot about -- is as powerful as it is insightful and moving.",1
27783, The film is a reminder that no single studio has a monopoly on thoughtful animated features.,1
200262, Steps out on the edge with a fearless exploration of life told with exceptional creativity. A refreshing and remarkable accomplishment.,1

200355, Only the youngest audience members will be amused (if a bit squirmy); older kids and parents will find their patience tested. At least Pixar's peerless animation remains a treat.,0
236250," Unsubtle, uneven and undeniably effective.",1
151498, Meadowland harrowingly depicts the delayed and very different reactions of a New York wife and husband to their son's abduction some 12 months earlier.,1

132240," It's entertaining, but not necessarily a good movie. [Full review in Spanish]",0
98093, The title's parenthetical plural sums up the problem with Some Girl(s): Five slow-cook dialogues that reveal the nice-guy protagonist as a super-tool is four too many.,0
197912," The narrative pileup feels like a game of Indiewood channel surfing, toggling between several mediocre options.",0

132733," The Tale of Despereaux looks like it was made about 10 years ago and, at a time when even mediocre animated films can generally boast a stunning look, this movie's uninspired animation is a source of disappointment.",0
117722, Casting LIZZIE - a telling of how the Borden Ax Murders might have gone - as a gothic horror film makes a certain amount of sense. If only they had given the thing a pulse.,0
210178," An eye-opening look at one couple's response to the dearth of public services, therapies and programs for their son.",1
73190," Tangerine builds beautifully towards a messy and hilarious climax. Mr. Baker's film is full of wit, but also compassion, and its street-level momentum reminded me of early Truffaut. It's that good.",1

150143, The uneven film ran out of gas way before it crossed the finishing line.,0
166066," We've got a movie about a futuristic city that doesn't spend much time in the futuristic city, instead focusing on a road trip/chase plot line with mostly uninteresting characters.",0
106597," The arch tone coupled with the compassion for the foibles of existence are everywhere in evidence here, brought to life with sterling performances by an ensemble cast that works as a cohesive whole while being standouts individually",1
173026," Von Dormael's mischievous sense of humour is displayed in tiny, unexpected details... But other jokes, like a woman with a gorilla soul-mate, feel sluggish by comparison.",0
235157, This comedy works very well... [Full review in Spanish],1
235075, Edwardian thriller offers formula instead of vision,0
75847, This is an excellent mystery with superb performances all-round.,1
108419," Interstellar has more of absolutely everything: more plot, more (stupid) words, more acting and much more bad acting (Anne Hathaway) than nearly all the year's films put together, as well as the most idiotic storyline of the decade.",0
169380," The usual mix of anus-and-penis-fixated gags, ritual female humiliation (Leslie Mann, as always, deserves far better), and insincere, late-inning attempts to show us that all of these wacky shenanigans have turned Dave and Mitch into better people.",0
198839," Just another depressing, nihilistic horror flick.",0
12992," We know how it turns out, but seeing from the point of view of someone who doesn't know and doesn't believe adds more cogency.",1
59952," If you leave this film without a smile on your face, you must have done something wrong. Go back and watch it again.",1
146020, It's all a bit underwhelming.,0
91774, Chow reveals astonishing depths. But the revelation is Yeoh.,1
180147," Luis Bunuel's cheerfully brazen satire of sexual repression, social decorum, and erotic fantasies is in the running for Bunuel's kinkiest film, and that's saying a lot.",1
79455, Do movies ever attempt to analyze the entire weave of life? Now they do.,1
1635," Proceeding with a blunt and sometimes brutal relentlessness, 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days impresses and engrosses as a work of stark, spare naturalism.",1
94014," Waltz with Bashir uses vivid, hand-drawn animation to bring to life interviews Folman conducted with friends who were involved in the Lebanese war in the early 1980s.",1
15429," Bier spices up the long-hackneyed generic formula with lush location cinematography, outstanding performances ... and subtitles, but otherwise the movie needs a lot more than love.",0
212507, It's no wonder Marlon's family wanted nothing to do with it.,0
9411, Its genre elements are completely honed down to their basest elements and exploited for the most fun possible.,1
81805," A gorgeous gut-punch of a movie, almost like Gabriel García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude tinted with bleakness and set in a unique gangster world.",1
56069," This ultra-mild frolic follows the 'fish-out-of-water' comedy formula so closely its lack of surprise is almost, well, surprising.",0
186382," Did Sen. Ted Kennedy (an electrifying Jason Clarke) leave a female passenger to drown when his car plunged off a bridge in 1969? Instead of scandal, this questing film examines the broken moral compass of a driven politician. ",1
164589," In this film there is little to [Steve Jobs] but conflict, and that can be somewhat tiresome to watch.",1
51249, ...a sobering reflection of our post 9/11 world and how efforts to control natural energy resources have far reaching and disastrous effects.,1
89905," Fast-paced, scathingly intelligent, wryly cynical, and totally engrossing from start to finish, it is a first-rate screed and a compellingly relevant film.",1
68370," The only thing saving this film are the performances from Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. If you are looking for a little excitement you'll get it from this film, but for me I could wait for the DVD.",0
162981, Turning McConaughey into a wreck through makeup and lighting is not an adequate substitute for character development.,0
16505," Crowe boring, Banks miscast, script awful, me no likey.",0
108854," The result may only be satisfying for true believers, but in a pop culture awash in tights and capes, maybe it's OK for a little navel-gazing into our collective obsession with superheroes. ",1
131105," If the Spice Girls don't precisely act here, they do give extroversion a good name.",1
126329, Seeming spawned from some ghoulish dream I felt nothing warm or symbolic of a tradition from this film.,0

74845, A giant yawn that proves once again that sex as a cinematic subject is one colossal turn-off.,0
196665, Even actual therapy wouldn't be this monotonous. ,0
138302," Spooky, atmospheric direction and a colorful turn by Depp clash with the dumbed-down storyline and veritable booty of pirate cliches.",0

119166, One of the best war movies ever made!,1
169571," Horrible Bosses 2 is by no means an atrocity, but it's tired and unexceptional, which is perhaps worse.",0
161029," More often than not, Theron gives us a caricature rather than a character. As a result, Monster is a well-made movie without much purpose.",0
223369," While 2046 looks absolutely radiant, its deliberately choppy structure and mannered style make it very heavy going...like watching a brilliant paint job dry in a storm.",0
205661," From the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers opening, through the Starsky & Hutch ""gunfight in a warehouse"" set-pieces, to the contractual-obligation shots of Kurylenko's bum, this is utter pants.",0
94131," an exquisite, dreamy romance that drifts among different time periods, locations and maybe even life and death itself",1
106095," We are in the mythical ""critics will hate it but audiences will love it"" zone, and since the movie aims to be nothing more than a weekend moneyspinner, it is accordingly forgettable and disposable.",0
15608," Why did Soderbergh want to remake an old film noir, anyway? Take out the crime elements and flesh out the human elements here, and you have a more interesting movie, I think.",0
145803," It doesn't so much look back longingly at past masters like Vincente Minnelli, Nicholas Ray, Stanley Donen and Jacques Demy (to name a few) as tap into their mojo, insisting on their modernity and its own classicism in the same gesture.",1
87130, Shyamalan wants the rustling of wind through greenery to evoke the same shudders in The Happening that the gathering of birds did in Hitchcock's The Birds  Read More | Original Score: C- ,0
83584," From Disney's richest period, interleaving splendid animation with vulgar Americana.",1
34048," A Simple Favor is compulsively watchable, a downmarket spin on Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train that is enthralling mostly because it's never clear what the hell is going to happen next.",1
180543," It's not a masterpiece, but it isn't supposed to be. It is, however, a perfectly pleasant film for young children.",0
75091," With its instantly catchy score, imaginative choreography and rat-tat-tat pacing, Chicago is as weighty as a bag of cotton candy, and just as addictive.",1
53132, This version lacks the occasional brilliant flashes of the first.,0
192056, Hoffman and Phoenix are at the top of their game -- given what little they really have to work with.,1
142837, The Oath is (at first) a scarily realistic and darkly funny depiction of the political argument feedback loop that rips some families apart. But the violent last act allows Barinholtz to slip away without an idea for leaving that loop.,1
136805," Comes not to praise history but to bury it in layers of prestige, the disaster's surviving documenters in the blues not even given a chance to be heard.",0
169990, A contender for worst film of the year.,0
196159," In Fabric's approach to its victims, combined with its aesthetic, renders everything a bit frigid.",0
199829," It's 9 am, on Wednesday June 7th, and I'm calling it on the Dark Universe, dear readers.",0
233858," Taylor's frantic pace and hiccupping camera mirror Cage's lunatic energy, and clever writing toys with our expectations while delivering a surprisingly transgressive film.",1
47721," It's a pleasure to watch, even if the payoff is rather less substantial than the backstory.",1
41," This is a cute movie, a kid's movie, and a rather good one.",1
41455, None of the millions of dollars in cutting-edge animation and high-priced talent have managed to come up with anything quite approximating the charms and delights that Dr. Seuss was able to conjure up in just a handful of storybook pages.,0
13083, Few documentaries about living artists get as deep into their subject's brain and heart as this one about the rock priestess and poetess.,1
164546," Like [Tilda] Swinton's performance, I Am Love is a bit of a show-off.",1
195618," Sure, it's a parlour trick movie, with no great idea at its core, but props should go to Blakeson -- he's packed a remarkable amount of thrills into a one-bedroom flat location.",1
112009," The movie is determinedly low-key, but honest, with a wrenching break-up scene, sharp work from Clarkson, and a final thought that lingers, about never really knowing what your other half is thinking.",1
128481, I'm on board with finding out what happens next. Can there be a bigger compliment?,1
213646," Although the tragicomic episodes that make up Another Year seem casual and low-key, they encompass birth, death and everything in between. ",1

39416, It is a joy-filled reminder of the high points of a career we hope is just hitting its stride.,1
53842," Filmmaker Neil Burger is more interested in whizzy visuals and a thorny plot to pay much attention to the characters or larger underlying themes, which leaves the film feeling eerily superficial.",1
185779," The Grandmaster is a martial-arts film, whose complicated narrative strategies and ambitious attempt to re-stylize a form that looks to be increasingly moribund, sets it apart from its generic brethren.",1
206460," Well, at least it's not another origin story. ",0
151934," If a white towel had been handy as I screened the punishingly long and dreadful Kingsman: The Golden Circle, I would have thrown it at the screen and made a wish: Please make it stop.",0
72295," While the thriller set against the concrete jungle of Mumbai isn't particularly memorable, its lead player Kothari has a longer shelf-life. Watch this solely for Khan.",1
181580, Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is basically a sillier version of an already silly concept - but that doesn't mean it isn't fun.,1
13391," In the end, this is a story about a hard-to-know guy who loves his typewriter most of all. Everything else is just dust-jacket photography.",0
12663," Lee is a long way from the size and scope of his best film, Do the Right Thing, but at least he is working on a subject he cares about and is doing it with polish.",0
203943," These six stories add up to an achievement that is wise, ridiculous, gorgeous, hideous, and contains some of the best onscreen monologues and original characters of all time. ",1
141360, ... essentially launched the heist film as a genre of its own and set the blueprint that all subsequent heist dramas built upon.,1
138517," River Runs Red is a film that is about a very serious issue but tends to sometimes take a campy approach to it. I could have done without a few of the scenes, but it was a pretty good story with a cast that makes the film work.",1
249079," The five year olds for whom this ghastly piece of post-content confection is intended are unlikely to see beyond the bright colours, fast movement and hit song covers to realise it has one of the stupidest story set-ups ever to appear in a kids' film.",0
89513," Overall, fatally ersatz but good natured at heart.",0
43447," Take away everything that was original about BLADE, add some exploding vampires, bad acting, and vampire night at the WWF - you get BLADE II, a knock-off, rip-off waste of film, released to suck the blood (and money) out of audiences everywhere.",0
180273," While the story of Give Me Liberty unpacks like a kinetic sphere of energy through a snowballing procession of charismatically comical events, none of this is possible without the convincing cast Mikhanovsky constructs.",1
202671," It's a decent comeback for Soderbergh, though not one that fires on all cylinders.",1
95613," all too much of the message is laced with New Age ideas, some of which are actually dangerous. ",0
43509," You have never seen a movie like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon because there has never been a movie like it.",1

147758, Beauty & The Beast broke new ground while recapturing the spirit of Disney traditionalism. ,1
244472," Not, maybe, the most rigorous of Christmas Carol adaptations, although it is a lot more faithful than one would perhaps have expected... at any rate a great Muppet film.",1
32513, The characters are so classically stereotypical that an attack on the war reads as little more than an easy attack on soldiers that adds insult to injury,0

4256," Whiteout conditions don't translate well to the action genre, either. Unless you don't mind watching unidentifiable snow-suited folks grapple in -50C conditions with an also-unidentifiable icepick-wielding murderer as CG ice violently pelts down on them.",0
90376," A fairy tale concept enlivened with average special effects, a plight predicated upon purportedly epic affection rendered with the most rote and unearned of emotion, and a tale supposedly larger-than-life but lacking in enthusiasm or investment.",0
190863, A total waste of time and talent....,0
240389," ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" develops characters the likes of which film rarely sees, features strong performances, has an impressive score, and a pretty powerful message. Unfortunately it comes off a little too artistic for it's own good. ",1

59569, So nondescript that its anonymity becomes its very personality.,0
61734, There's a whiff of the canned here; these actors may have played their parts once too often for the camera to register any real freshness.,0

148015," An acutely observed portrait of the lives of first and second generation Chinese immigrants, subjects who otherwise don't see much in the way of Hollywood limelight.",1
54105," The tagline sleazily states: ""See it with someone you fuck,"" when, in fact, you should just fuck someone you fuck. This is one experience you'll want to miss out on.",0
4361," Sweet and well-observed, Whisper is about self-discovery and little else",1
79382," Zoolander No 2 is pretty funny whenever it isn't trying to recreate bits from the first one, which is a lot, unfortunately. ",1
33868, [Chloe Grace Moretz's Mia] seems like Carrie without any hope of a looming body count.,0
71596," The film lives up to its hype with a style, swagger and substance that will appeal not just to the fanboys (and girls) but to their uninitiated friends as well.",1
82068," Unlike Cage's reliable merchandise in the film, Niccol's supposedly explosive exposé misfires with every other shot.",0
230505," Even fantasy needs verisimilitude, and if you're going to have your hero producing planes out of thin air, miles from any apparent airstrip, as Bond does, why stop there? Surely no need for a plane. Just have him zoom through the air, arms outstretched.",0
200688," Indeed: if the sequels' eternal challenge is how to live up to the original without repeating itself, let's say that Deadpool 2 is a worthy second part, but it does not have the advantage of [surprise]. [Full review in Spanish]",1
99175," Somewhere between the off-target outright dismissals and the overindulgent geek praise lies Zack Snyder's Watchmen, and it's a sensational sight to behold.",1

178941," An elliptical relationship drama that works largely due to the nuanced acting; the nuanced, sumptuous camera work; and the nuanced, gorgeous people on screen.",1
171629, A bold but uneven cocktail of Gilliam-esque dystopian satire and the sort of girl-befriends-mythical-beast parable that could have been visualised by Studio Ghibli ...,1
16754, I've learned the ugly truth about Elle Woods: she's only good for one movie.,0
133274," It didn't always work for me,but this is one of Winterbottom's most ambitious films, and it's good to see that he's continuing to stretch himself.",1

24861, Good fun for the last 90 minutes. Take a sandwich for the first 40.,1
182863," It's hard to begrudge such an earnest endeavour, but this is missing the wit, nuance, and insight of a book thought by many - correctly, maybe - to be unadaptable.",0
10481," It's the kind of movie where, even if you miss the ads, you can guess you'll be seeing Toby Jones.",0
31769, What's really important in the film is all internal and Reichardt's direction and the excellent performances of all four women give us the time to see below the surface and start to feel how these women themselves experience their lives. ,1
235327," It's not that What Men Want isn't enjoyable, it's just that, while you're watching, you get the sense that it could have been so much more. This film is proof that it takes more than genderswapping to make something old new again.",0

136288, The familiar story has been put in the hands of director Kenneth Branagh and has been transformed into a magical piece of filmmaking.,1

4510, This film won't be troubling awards season. Unless they're handing out Oscars for leading eyebrows.,0
25694, Mickle and co-writer Nick Damici give themselves plenty of time to tease out their themes and ladle on the tension.,1

101063," Underneath it all, ""The Gift"" is a merciless critique of an amoral corporate culture in which the ends justify the means, and lying and cheating are O.K., as long as they're not found out.",1
164938," At least the film looks great, but without much of a spark, 'Trance' can only make you sleepy - very sleepy.",0
213039," Though engaging and sweet, with a nice feel for the purgatory-like blankness of mental hospital life, It's Kind Of A Funny Story suffers from a serious, if not quite fatal, attack of the cutes.",1
249346, It's insightful and compassionate without ever being mawkish about people we perhaps all too easily choose to write off. ,1
222998," As muted and still as a Vermeer painting, Girl With a Pearl Earring has atmosphere to burn and a near-total action vacuum.",0
234154, A few highlights hint at a more interestingly devilish picture than the McDonald's meal director Rawson Marshall Thurber ultimately slaps together here. ,0
189776," Spielberg, the analog stalwart, has brought out the best in this new filmmaking technology.",1

208644," What in the world can you say about this? The purest, funniest and most endearing Muppet flick--it's simply the pinnacle of extant evidence we have to the genius of Henson and those he surrounded himself with. Highly recommended.",1
3930," The New Romantic (the debut feature of writer-director Carly Stone) is too slight, both in terms of theme and general characterization, to match up to Barden's performance (which will probably not get the attention it deserves).",1
236148," Gripping and discomfiting, this first directorial feature by the veteran editor is the kind of diaristic inquiry that can seem self-indulgent but here sports a fearlessness that transcends vanity - at times it's downright unflattering.",1

67672," The 1959 film was an overlong affair, too, but it endures as one of the greatest of all sword-and-sandals epics. This version will endure for only as long as it takes the accountants to work out the losses.",0
32752," The rock bands, as is so often the case in movies, are no more convincing than the group that once won ironic favour in a Kit Kat commercial.",0
107793, Morrissey gives a good impersonation of a lobotomised Liam Neeson: possibly the only way to play a character dead from the script upwards.,0

36484, Jamie Jay Johnson's immensely entertaining documentary about Junior Eurovision is right on the money.,1
165933, Men Who Stare at Goats is one massively long Star Wars joke that gets annoying quick.,0
96051," The movie -- as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is -- has the annoyance of incredible smugness. It is, one could say, blinded by the hindsight.",0
94541," Earth hits all the right notes, and if Disney corners the market on nature documentaries and creates an annual cinematic event of this caliber tied into Earth Day, so be it.",1
126671, Pretty soapy -- and not even a very exciting soap opera. But perhaps a less-than-stellar Masterpiece Theatre production would be a better comparison. ,0

181559," Lyrical, whimsical and strange, Isle of Dogs is a Wes Anderson movie through and through. That's a good thing.",1
67486," There's a melancholy hanging over the film, too -- that it's [Melissa] Mathison's final screenwriting credit. It's also a lovely exit for a woman who always knew to never write down to her audience, children or not.",1
179934," Rather surprisingly, the second Jumanji caper has a ""big idea"" that extends beyond opportunistic brand recognition, with more than a nod to The Breakfast Club.",1
96337, There's something endearing in the way Benton assumes a little full-frontal is enough to erase the bile that develops watching this agonizing marathon of navel-gazing.,0
60970," It's as preachy as ""The Crucible,"" with the score permanently set on ""mournful.""",0
184317," It's easy to laugh at a dumb person, but not so much if that person has deeper handicaps. Even if that was not the intention of the filmmakers, that is unfortunately how it is received.",0
251044," Any fan of dark, dark comedy will need to seek this film out (and it's kind of hard to find), as its influence is still palpable 30 years later.",1
18601," The Mechanic is adequate light entertainment for those who enjoy thrillers, but it is uneven and the underwhelming ending will disappoint those who enjoyed the delicious irony served up by its predecessor.",0

123137," At once busy and simplistic, the movie lacks A Hijacking's suspense and moral urgency and Captain Phillips' fleshed-out performances. What it offers instead is a slick sense of style and a surfeit of credible detail.",0
149266," A light, funny, blissfully entertaining flick about heavy, sadly still relevant themes.",1
232789," Surely the rocker, an incredible admirer of horror films, realized his final product wasn't above the standards of the kind of straight-to-video shlock that even Elvira or Sybil Danning would be ashamed to present.",0

7802," Thought-provoking, philosophical and always interesting, ""The Invisible"" is likely to remain that way, particular when Spidey swings on to the big screen. It's too bad that this well-wrought, intelligent movie may not find an audience %u2013 perhaps a DVD",1

83161, This comic-book knockoff of The A-Team...is a lot easier to enjoy than Fox's sanctioned remake of The A-Team. Perhaps that's because Sylvain White's The Losers is self-aware of its schlock value...[Blu-ray],0

108424, A little Bridget unfortunately goes a long way.,0

144115," The truth doesn't always make for good stories, and neither does pure invention necessarily, although a canny blend here does deliver some lightweight entertainment.",1
18889," Basically, it's the Little Rascals to the rescue in a flick dressed up as a mystical fable replete with medieval mumbo jumbo and some cool, state-of-the-art special f/x. Otay!",1
224539, It's slacker trash camp -- and the prominent rôle played by a mop bucket (used as a portal by an ancient marine deity) betrays the film's Troma-like affiliations.,0
207064," Outside In is distinguished from the mass of ""sad person returns to his/her hometown"" movies by virtue of Shelton's inimitable skill as an actor's director. ",1
24213," Smart's enthusiasm and core goodness holds an appeal no superb assassinatrix can ignore. With that, the mission to accomplish hilarity at the expense of action drama pays off.",1
98374," It's a commendable effort, although the result never quite achieves the sense of discovery or deeper emotional resonance to which it aspires. Rather than warming your heart, the film winds up leaving a chill.",0

28318," Solo, like the Falcon in Empire, tends to sputter just when it should leap into hyperdrive.",0
30235," 42 delivers a powerful story, adding one more crucial piece to the puzzle that is American history. But as for a fleshed-out biopic that provides more pieces to the puzzle that was Jackie Robinson, the man? For that, you'll have to wait.",1

4613," A crackerjack sequel that matches, and in some ways surpasses, its predecessor.",1

204287, Anna Kendrick's assured lead performance elevates this Glee-type musical affair from its modest confines.,1
73939," Natural, low-key performances from a cast led by Chloë Grace Moretz highlight a movie that eschews grandstanding - this modest story about self-discovery and community would rather celebrate the small victories against intolerance. ",1

74338," Admirable but not very engaging SF drama that either fails to recognize the potential of its central conceit, or else is too afraid to confront it head-on.",0
226147, A solid biopic that is elevated to another level thanks to strong work from McConaughey and Jared Leto.,1

201849," Insurgent is a relentlessly exasperating sci-fi film made, miraculously, with a half-baked imagination, a slaughtered wit, and insufferable direction by Robert Schwentke, the man who supplied 2013 with one its biggest flops, R.I.P.D.",0

141768," What began as a respectable, if somewhat flat 17th-century love story, complete with gorgeous costumes and lush score, seems to lose its wits as it goes along -- which may have been the mindset of the era, but feels like a miscalculated opportunity here.",0
217621, A pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking.,1
234920, A movie that cares much more for poetic choreography in explosive gunfights than gaping lapses of logic in a flimsy crime narrative.,0
236055," The miracle is not that this guy lost five girlfriends, but that he ever attracted them in the first place.",0
102232," There's not really anything here you don't already know. Nevertheless, the film is dramatically compelling, with excellent performances. ",1
17908, The overall effect of Waking Life is that of finally escaping a cocktail party full of ecstasy-laden philosophy students.,0

98822, Even so-so Hornet forerunners like The Phantom (and certainly downright thrilling one-shots like The Rocketeer) are more entertaining than this cheesy and borderline-boring cream puff of a vigilante.,0
43005," ""The heart wants what it wants,"" Woody Allen has taught us, and apparently what his heart wants these days is not to have to bother with writing second drafts of film scripts.",0

137262," Hazy both as a portrait of teenage excess (a lot of pouting, kissing, and kicking of dustbins) and as an account of The Runaways' fame in the second half of the 1970s (they appear to have been big in Japan).",0
188333," Harnessing the simplicity and reach of the Internet is an appropriate technique for this doc, because it's about just that. But using Skype is also a genius tip for any doc maker on a budget. Which is every doc maker.",1

247269," This ultra-gory speculative noir is, at its infrequent best, certifiably nuts; the rest of the time, it's one numbingly brutal slog.",0
50434," It's a reminder of a time when TV journalists challenged authority rather than defended it, drew on indignation rather than on self-righteousness, promoted clarity instead of deceit.",1

227416," Isabel Rose has talent and moxie, rising above the mixed material of the movie.",0
109320," 'Carol' feels like the third part of a loose trilogy of films set in the past, about women who are trapped by the confines of their time. ",1

120220, Solo: A Star Wars Story commits to being a charming and fun exercise in repackaging nostalgia and pre-owned protagonists. It's just too bad its script never fully committed to seeing through Han's arc ... to its preordained end.,1

1941," Nothing and no one seems to be holding [Sorkin] back, for better and for worse.",1
154083," Fans may be drawn by the cast, but word of mouth will be grim for a movie that takes a slow road to nowhere.",0
111243, A good transition movie that doesn't deliver the same punch as the original.[Full review in Spanish],1
103869," The trippy, highly mannered, widely referential imagery is certainly its strongest selling point, despite wonderfully grounding (and, on the rides, bizarre) work by Lopez.",1
103697," Ultimately, it works in large part because of a fine cast, and Van Sant's sensitive work with them.",1
99310," There's something about Love, Simon that feels like a bona fide event...It's a film that we swooned and winced and cringed and grinned through, the journey the best coming-of-age movies take their audiences on. ",1
109757," Serra's slow-burn romp depicts in enchanting natural light the revolutionary shift from the Enlightenment to irrationalism. Broadly symbolic, the film is also detailed enough that we can see particles of dust move through the air.",1

85792, ...a passable yet somewhat disappointing look at an iconic American figure. ,1
170629," Certainly not the worst of the endless stream of TV remakes, but given the unassuming, easy charm of the original, still wide of the mark by a country mile.",0
107755," Nods to Jack Pierce's iconic, Karloffian monster design of 1931, Victorian opium consumption, and even Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein pop out all over the place, nicely placed and often when you least expect them.",1

84558," Happy Death Day 2U is more fun than terrifying, but it captures the heart that many sequels fail to have. [Full Review in Spanish]",1

163506," Carell and Fey are good company and work hard, but this is still a formulaic tale that will look most at home on the back of an airplane seat. In other words, A Shawn Levy Film.",0
249984," Walk away from the straightforward legal drama and you will learn this towering, influential titular figure . . . was a smooth lawyer in 1940. ",0
36976," While nothing is more dramatic than the change at the core of this film - Katniss' move from survivor to leader - it's not enough, on its own, to comfortably sustain a two-and-a-half-hour film.",0

25431," A taut, historical thriller about the capture of one of Nazism's most evil. ",1
102556," There is a good movie inside of Batman v Superman, which makes it all the more frustrating that the stuff the movie gets wrong, it gets really wrong.",0
168848," The Witch"" isn't typical gorehound material; it has an art film prestige and a commitment to period authenticity.",1
10887," The Cider House Rules conjures up enough drama, wry humor, character quirks, passion and tragedy to do its author proud.",1

227890," It's vividly animated, it's friendly -- and it's not too long.",1
237388," The breadth of interviews was quite good, and the film goes to great pains to situate Lennon within the wider political framework of the day. Everyone from G. Gordon Liddy to Geraldo are trotted out to either decry or justify the treatment that the Nixon",1
35675, The emotion and drama Shyamalan produces is painstakingly truthful once the seemingly absurd is introduced.,1
231574, Hart seems to be desperately underwater for most of the movie.,0

229050," Recommending a movie without a plot sounds ludicrous. That is, unless the movie is 'Boyhood' and the movie was written and directed by Richard Linklater, whose 'Before Sunrise,' 'Before Sunset' and 'Before Midnight' are beloved by so many film-goers.",1
23189," It's poignant that Myers, a man of great fortune and no shortage of film ideas, would choose to make his first feature a paean to a friend and mentor whom many viewers may not even know. It is an act of class and kindness befitting the movie's subject.",1
220633," I Want to Believe will be tossed on the heap with the rest of the unnecessary remakes, adaptations and sequels. ",0
146648," Buried within Another Earth's framework is a wonderful sci-fi movie, but Cahill and Marling have unfortunately set it amongst this otherwise drab and predictable human drama.",0

86552, [It] has the aroma of an autobiographical confession by someone for whom life hasn't been overly difficult.,0
19047," It does nothing better than John Carpenter's version, but it borrows and steals enough of the stuff that works from his film to carry it to some level of lowest-common-denominator entertainment.",1
120401," At every step, Hanks excels at showing what's really going on in the character's mind while maintaining his facade of almost folksy calm. It isn't one of the actor's rangiest roles, but it culminates in an eruption of emotional fireworks ...",1
38538," Puss proves more than capable and deserving of the solo spotlight, his outsize bravado, machismo, ego spilling out beyond the big screen in fiercely funny feline fashion.",1
63272, How do you know you've got a dud? When a cast this talented and determined can't lift a soporific screenplay to entertaining heights.,0
216699, The character design is ugly; the main characters are often annoying; the humor is generally weak; and the computer-generated animation is often soulless.,0

232468, long on build and short on payoff. It says a lot that the most memorable character in this tale of American bravery overcoming incredible odds is the Afghani warlord who would become the country's vice president.,0
233377," Sometimes plain unfunny, lazy writing/improvising. Sometimes, very sharply scripted, shot and paced. Overall, the picture eventually weaseled its way into my favor.",1
207956, The movie is at least a bit less annoying than director Alex Proyas' previous two genre attempts.,0
215460," This clumsy little E.T. for the NASCAR set has seen its release repeatedly delayed for nearly two years, and it shows tell-tale signs of desperate tinkering.",0

40215, A perfect father-son movie.,1
95844," Infused with local colour, this Peruvian film finds real resonance in its light handling of a personal journey. Without overstating its themes or sentimentalising the drama, filmmaker Llosa tells a story we'll never forget.",1

243906, It's so sweet but it has the cynical heart of pre-WWII America.,1
41874," Like the worst of late-period Allen, the film recycles character types from his previous work without inventing new reasons to summon them into existence.",0
39297," A visually stunning and often surprising true story that charts the rise of the Colombian drug business back before Escobar from its unexpected roots, among an indigenous clan in way over their heads.",1

56589, Takes the kind of imagery normally used to sell beer and pick-up trucks and turns it into something sublime.,1
69104," It's an earnest movie made with the best intentions, but rather flatly directed by the Oscar-winning Bosnian film-maker Danis Tanovic - and blandly acted by Emraan Hashmi...",0
125966," [Liam] Neeson lands plenty of punches, but the movie works best when he's fighting shadows or fighting himself.",1
63706," It seems to have been written in a tone of magical realism, but the director is Paul Schrader, a filmmaker who has many talents, but no feel for whimsy, let alone magic.",0
186194, ...an unabashed disaster - an epitome of awful Hollywood cliche and Unthinking Screenwriting 101 so egregious that Michael Bay himself would likely spit on it.,0

62517," Scenes take twice as long as they should, but we do learn how 'triangulated' people make romantic choices.",1
60209," I won't say this for many films, but ""Godzilla"" needs more carnage and intensity, and less of anything else it has.",0
227200, Fresh and original movie where geeks meet street with very funny consequences. A terrific cast and smart script make this Sundance sensation a summer winner.,1

239426," Scorsese's best film? Difficult to call, though if it doesn't beat Raging Bull, it runs it a close second.",1
41847," With Costner's yokel having a decided preference for being handed a beer rather than a ballot, he does a pretty darn good job of exposing the phony platitudes and pandering of candidates, in a movie about bad news politicians and even badder parenting.",1
163486," In terms of literal visual content, Caniba isn't that extreme. But it's so real, so intimate with its repulsive subjects, that it's an especially difficult watch. ",1

163291," It's unfortunate that Enter the Void is so fundamentally idiotic, its unholy combination of Tibetan Buddhism and crude melodrama becoming maddeningly repetitive and turgid.",0
201911, Carries sufficient charm and a bit of unexpected depth to justify its breezy existence.,1
162020," Fur flies in this frothy, innocuous, critter-filled romp - but it's certainly not worth the 3-D price bump.",0
169140," Yes, it's strongly geared to the teen audience, but don't hold it against the filmmakers and go in with any preconceived notions and you'll find it a fun opening chapter of a new franchise.",1

58309, There's a lot of big missteps...but it's not as terrible as some people are going to say. ,0
227312," It persuades us early on that its aura of political tension and suspicion, its taciturnity, its very strictness of silent observation as it begins, are fostering an intelligent thriller.",1
211135, Greengrass is so determined not to exploit the deaths by 'entertaining' moviegoers that his film becomes almost an academic exercise -- an experiment to determine at what point deadpan dramatization plus audience anticipation equal emotional devastation.,1
170561," Divergent is aimed squarely at the kind of audience who will already have watched The Hunger Games films, and the comparison does it no favours.",0
166395," While a noble effort in terms of scale and ambition, Oblivion entertains only sporadically. There's a great film somewhere in there, but this isn't it.",0

8425, This thing is madness.,0
8854," The good cast does what it can with the weak material, but the waste of talent only makes the film's total failure that much more regrettable.",0
217205, There is nothing revolutionary about Creation but it tells an absorbing true story and finds a human perspective to some extraordinary historical events.,1
54640, What The Business of Strangers really boils down to is a couple of good performances and some really interesting dialogue.,1

193077," The Safdies' raw documentary aesthetic transforms the film into a tense, uncomfortable exposé of desperate, damaged people unsuccessfully trying to bend the world to their own will.",1
60987," 'Wreck-It Ralph' is a clutter of noise, eye-wearying animation, frenetic action and two-dimensional characters.",0
214800," In a summer movie landscape with Spider-Man, a simian army waging further battle for the planet and Charlize Theron as a sexy Cold War-era superspy, it says something that one of the most compelling characters is Al Gore.",1

7524," By the end, we're left with a feeling of depletion rather than resolution.",0
194303," Many are the film's hackneyed scenes, although Eastwood and Adams always make them at least enjoyable to watch. Trouble With the Curve doesn't hit the ball out of the park, but neither is it a compete shutout.",0
159684," While the movie's main concern -- skewering bourgeois hypocrisy -- is not particularly fresh or innovative, Chabrol's craft is so precise, his way with actors and the camera so sure-handed, even this ordinary story is often immensely enjoyable.",1

149390," Despite the weighty issues at play, there's much about the movie to simply enjoy -- the camaraderie of the brothers and the lawmen, and the not infrequent elements of humor. ",1
162642," There is something admirably perverse about a movie that treats the killings of Hitler and Bigfoot as secondary to a character study of a crusty old man and his regrets, but that doesn't make the film less dull or deflating to watch.",0
137174," It's very simply a great film, if for no other reason than the fact that it's brave enough to focus almost entirely on those things that ordinary films leave out, or take for granted.",1
9481," Tarantino has a created a more moving tale about the Jews and the Nazis during World War II than, for example, last year's much more reverent Defiance, which was actually based on a true story yet came off as shtick.",1

102085, A fine film that stands on its own merits and one that does an admirable job of staying faithful to the spirit of its source material.,1
54453," It's not deep and its lurid story may not stand up to logic, but if all you ask is that it's got action and someone to root for, it delivers.",1
84169," Not without its problems, but mostly a smart, engaging, bigotry-busting escapade with a hugely appealing young cast and an unflaggingly cheerful optimism.",1

120664," Simply put, Gameau's one-man experiment is not rigorous enough to prove anything at all, however striking his results seem.",0
13864," Gordon-Levitt is pitch perfect in the title role, gradually revealing the steely inner core behind his nerd-like exterior, and skilfully evoking Snowden's process of disillusionment as he sees more and more of the skull beneath the skin of his homeland.",1
203053," The late Kenji Mizoguchi, who directed Ugetsu, failed to show as much imagination in this one as in that one.",0
205348," While this film is strong in most of the critical areas, its overall vision is so violent, so bloody, and so hopeless, I simply cannot recommend it to anyone, myself included.",0
167951," Judi Dench and Steve Coogan are a warm and winning combination in Philomena, a tale that's a little too well-spun.",1
44075," Like many of the Slynyrd's lyrics, such simple words convey powerful passion to rock 'n' rebel. ""If I Leave Here Tomorrow"" captures it all well.",1
220698, A sweet yet occasionally heavy-handed comedy about class relations in 1962 Paris...,1
125879," A Rolls Royce romantic comedy set in Mumbai that rides on a delectable, bittersweet central turn by Irrfan Khan.",1
32351," While ""Greenberg"" wasn't as funny as I had hoped, I think it's a great film and in the end is a return to form for Baumbach.",1
74456," It's a powerful film - not because its story of a vengeful female will shine a light on social injustices, but simply because it grips viewers and doesn't let go until the credits are rolling. Maria Bello is a pain-stricken wonder. ",1
241637," At least the title is honest. The whole movie's an echo - of something better and far more original, now bounced back at us, more and more quietly, until it finally fades away.",0
95704," Elba and Larter are actually pretty good. Beyonce, through, strikes one note throughout.",0

109746, ...an exceedingly familiar premise that's used to almost extraordinarily innocuous effect...,0
120658," Chris Carter has succeeded so well in keeping the plot under wraps that even after you watch the imposing imagery, you leave the theater wondering who's conspiring against whom for what purpose.",0
231198, The kind of movie that seems to think a heap of outrageous details equals a characterization.,0
1027," I've only scratched the surface of this intelligent, riveting and informative film, which I cannot commend too highly.",1
131664," In ""A Thousand Words"" the camera stays about two inches from Murphy's hyperactive face, and you start to see the strain and desperation in the actor's eyes.",0
169872," ""Goosebumps 2"" isn't a movie, exactly - it's a piñata of effects posing as a movie. By the end, there's nothing to do but sweep up the pieces.",0
15156," The thrills are there, but it's not hard to be left wanting a lot more from a modern-day standoff between Jackie Chan and 007. ",0
157619," The actors fling themselves with forced charm into their narrowly defined roles, and Robespierre juggles the story lines with a bland vigor that lacks any observational, analytical, or symbolic dimension.",0
113789," With strong echoes of Let the Right One In, it is the setting that makes [director Michael] O'Shea's picture distinctive, and when he is mining that his otherwise routine piece soars far above the average.",1

198934, In which Kevin James yet again proves his absolute unfitness (in both senses) for the part of romantic comedy lead.,0
124877," It's rare that a movie that is concerned with issues currently in the headlines is more than that, but Aki Kaurismaki's touching and funny The Other Side of Hope, which focuses on the migrant crisis in Europe, pulls it off.",1
238847, Paul Solet's gyno-horror flick is certainly twisted but only slightly unnerving; the movie is about as gripping as one might expect given that its infant monster is both mute and cradle-bound.,0
41314," Gets to the heart of what it means to be happy and successful, or to try to be, without the kinds of huge moments, altercations and declarations that often find a place on screen.",1
169816," Bad Kids of Crestview Academy is certainly a film aware of how inherently daft it is, but it's nowhere near good enough to praise, nor does it reach the levels of endearingly bad in the way a legion of cult movies have remained popular.",0
38642," [A] bracingly dry, talky but ultimately fascinating work...",1
247957," Fans of the novel might consider this tired movie a wasted opportunity. For everyone else, it is just a waste of time.",0
219553," [VIDEO ESSAY] ""Kill the Messenger"" is a frustrating movie. It fails both as a brief biopic and as a political thriller. It works somewhat as a sketch character study, but that's not enough to satisfy a movie audience.",0
75915," Dated Disney horror tale has occult themes, mild scares.",0
249425," Talking about class can be ugly. Yet as AWOL asserts, when you dare to comment, sometimes it frees up room for beauty to unfurl.",1
12290, The only truly memorable or even slightly frightening thing is Tim Curry.,0
13913, a largely entertaining action thriller that doesn't go exactly where you expect it go and indulges in quite a bit of meta-commentary on the nature of comic book narratives.,1

193084," Frankly, it's a stinker.",0
60226," City offers star power, dashes of dazzle and plenty of movie nods. But Hughes' thriller fails to locate a life of its own.",0

191999, Watchable enough but ultimately forgettable.,1
123036, This may be a filmed play but Dolan's graceful treatment of the material ensures that it rarely feels too stagy or claustrophobic. ,1

247647, It's getting more than a little tiresome sitting through sport movies revolving around a team of under-aged underdogs and their curmudgeonly coach.,0
239015," It's a doomy dirge of a movie, in which the protagonists, or at least the actors who play them, aren't equipped to handle their outsize passions.",0

202387," Michael Moore takes scattershot aim at the presidency of George W. Bush, hitting some targets and missing others.",1
192285, The film and all its characters are as tacky and charmless at the end as they are on first impressions.,0
100746," Does the curdled thriller ""Wild Card"" represent a brief misstep? Or is this the moment when Jason Statham, like so many action heroes before him, settles into self-caricature?",0
200526," It has some promising moments, but there is something forced, contrived and a bit cliched about this fey British indie in the road-movie style.",0
125265," This bitter-sweet love story set to Michel Legrand's music from writer director Jacques Demy marks the film debut of the then 20 year old Catherine Deneuve, whose delicate beauty and screen presence has enchanted the world ever since",1
86606," Despite its intelligent agenda, swollen heart and fabulously epic surface, amounts to a didactic banality: a white guy's politically correct lesson abroad.",0
76104," A movie that comes from the heart, and gets deep inside. [Full review in Spanish]",1
243096," Offers enough laughs to offset the familiarity. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)",1
13566," War for the Planet of the Apes triumphantly caps this Apes trilogy. Equally remarkable, it leaves you wanting more.",1

78934, It's been over a year since CBS Films launched and their curse still isn't broken.,0

229199, Henceforth when people speak of movie magic they will think instantly of Martin Scorsese's mind-blowing 'Hugo.',1
4832," [The] screenwriters have no time for subtlety, assaulting the ear with an arsenal of dull tough-guy dialogue as the male characters take turns mowing down each other's manhood and delivering hard-boiled pseudoknowledge about the nature of evil.",0
77419, A film with potential and interesting moments that turns out underused in the second half. [Full review in Spanish],0
204947," In his 19th feature, Mr. Barreto assuredly embraces an approach that's counter to much received wisdom about Bishop's life and work. But his film ultimately dooms itself.",0
23650," I long for the days when Almodovar created movies that made me dizzy. He may still surprise us, but in the meantime, I'll settle for a mid-level offering like Julieta.",1
92701," The use of depth of field, negative spaces and the free flow of images... create, at times, a sensation of astonishment and optical novelty similar to what Lumiere's first short films provoked in his audience. [Full review in Spanish]",1
39792, A distanced but often car-crash compelling portrait of a teen as an unfinished being.,1

210768, Little more than torture porn tricked out in art-house finery.,0
196922," Cars runs out of gas long before it reaches the finish line. With twenty minutes cut it could have been a contender, but it's the worst Pixar film to date.",0

37303, Doesn't set out to reinvent the horror wheel but succeeds as solid genre entertainment.,1
172978, Morrison's book is painfully honest and whilst the film is sensitively handled and impeccably crafted it is also curiously distant and unmoving.,0

12703," Sometimes funny, sometimes smart, always watchable, but perhaps the film's dedication to turning a clever tale into something profound was a miscalculation.",1
99888," The politically incorrect jokes, while often funny, wear a bit thin as director Sophie Goodhart lays them on with naughty glee.",0

177831," Monster threequel is silly fun, with a few scary parts. ",1
70401," Despite a strong cast's admirable efforts, though, this ends up as a bit of an ill-defined muddle that should have focused more on fact than quirkiness.",0
237587, Frat-boy humor in every sense...a coarse and sloppy gross-out comedy made all the worse by the occasional moments that suggest it could have been something more.,0
146907," Colossal is an incredible idea that never quite delivers on its potential. Even so, it's really a film you should discover for yourself, warts and all.",1
104666," These scenes need solid emotional anchoring, and we get no sense of Tulasi's inner life. And without that, Diya is just a series of jump scares... that aren't much of jump scares.",0
43687," Even though it's a pulp western brimming with the director's usual blood, guts and wry humour, the racial politics are more contemporary in nature than in Django Unchained.",1
97280," Enjoyment of this film rather depends on believing that our security services might not only be corrupt but so inept that a young female barrister could overpower an agent with a licence to kill, and a 14-year-boy could easily escape from a safe house.",0
92679," This guy knows how to tell stories for audiences who can hold their own hands, thank you.",1
151154," Who'd have thought a flimsy, witless TV series like Baywatch could have spawned this boisterous, cheeky comedy?",1
6248, This story inspires and entertains with a vital chapter in this nation's history.,1
120847," What is the point, other than to show up the director's technical skill at presenting mutilation?",0
12103, It casts actors who look plausible and treats sex with honesty and no apologies.,1
144524, Not only light on laughs but discomfitingly didactic in its disgust.,0
190282," Pitt, entering his third decade of fame, continues to show how there was always a deadly serious actor in him all along.",1
72857," A trenchantly observed, bitingly witty comedy about just how mean girls can be.",1
148435, The film uses common places and local jokes to provoke the spectator's laughter to scenes that reveal that there's still much to do to reach a more inclusive society. [Full review in Spanish],1
171280, Is it still fun? Yes. Is it indulgent? Absolutely.,1
19017, One more overly crude teen comedy,0
126983, Large chunks of The General are completely incomprehensible.,0
80276," Overall, they've done a decent job, it's just not the masterpiece that the original was.",1
132620," A commercially savvy though ultimately empty combination of warped morality tale, mystery, gore-fest, and torture porn.",0
3054," Trying to tell two stories, Suburbicon ends up telling none at all.",0
2563, Baffles and bedazzles before blistering into a masterpiece.,1
179112," Gibson's passion is all over this film...but his resorting to mawkish, superficial tactics blows the tone off-course from time to time.",1
21587, An amazingly uneven and increasingly hysterical horror/melodrama that is so over the top that even the central performance of Jennifer Lawrence can't redeem it.,0
139965," Pedestrian as it peruses its corroded imagination, relying on cheap jokes and predictable situations to carry the movie, while Bateman the actor coasts through the effort half-asleep.",0
54089," City of Ember has almost anything one could want from a science fiction-based family adventure film: likeable characters, an imaginative setting, and a fast pace.",1
91530," Like DiCaprio's make-up, Clint Eastwood's biopic tries to cover too much.",1
195029," The Two Towers is a satisfying and wholly gripping drama in its own right. Inevitably, Janus-like, it looks back to the Shire, and forward to the hour of doom. And after three hours, you will too.",1
15562, This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own.,0
104157," ""Don't Worry"" isn't the best of Van Sant, but there are flashes, which will, for some viewers, be enough.",1
78952," A hard-R comedy that wants badly to push buttons and shock/amuse us with its wink-wink ""dirty"" jokes, four- and ten- and twelve-letter words, and graphic sexual references, unaware that while dirty can be funny, dirty does not necessarily EQUAL funny.",0
206371," Tarantino is making his points and although it's too long, it is a spectacle to enjoy, a mix between The Canterbury Tales, Cluedo and spaghetti westerns.",1
225415, Another historical drama that conflates an important story with good storytelling. The cast does an admiral job of attempting to raise the material but Operation Finale struggles tonally almost from the first scene. ,0
104354," This Avengers film is so horrendously, painfully and thoroughly awful, it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar and Howard the Duck a good name.",0
16885," A daring, startling piece of work. And not only for what Inarritu manages to show. But for what Keaton is courageous enough to reveal.",1
180716," Cheerful, not too scary, easily digestible (albeit some of the dialogue is indecipherable for us non-Chipmunks) and relentlessly energetic, Chip-Wrecked stays afloat delightfully",1
137200," The intentionally bad songs and the early scenes in New York City are amusing, but the movie totally falls apart once Beatty and Hoffman arrive in the fictional country of Ishtar.",0
186151, That [Eckhart's] all-out capital-A acting nonetheless comes off as a misguided mess is vindicated by the fact that nothing about this movie is likely to be remembered long-term anyway.,0
173169," The living conditions it projects are as horrendous as I had feared, but the movie is surprisingly easy to take as a rollicking homicidal entertainment.",1
80475," I liked the set-up and the mythology. The villain took me out of it a lot, but other than that, I enjoyed the ride.",1
164207," professes to be an honest depiction of ancient Roman excesses, but it succeeds only in being alternately boring and offensive",0
57178," I appreciated the girl power element of the film, but Ghostbusters is a stellar cast in a bland movie. ",0
15392, D'Anna and Knudsen maintain a fantastic hauteur. Both lingerie and perfume are mentioned in the credits. Some may find all this a little arousing. Such reactions are allowed. ,1
120842," 3/4 is a small but ambitious drama with a perfectly symmetrical structure, using minimal means, nonprofessional actors, and everyday conversations to convey its characters' innermost feelings. ",1
151237, It works as a funny and slicker-than-expected parody of the genre.,1
93720," Should have been called ""The Chronicles of Arthritic."" The movie is so lame, it needs a cane by the time it lumbers into its final act.",0
158602," It flits between hallucinatory animation and 'reality', giving small moments of relief and attempting to anchor the story in a desolate Los Angeles.",1
9360," For tales that require some edge, it is safe to deduce that Ron Howard is no match for the great Dr. Seuss.",0
17478," It's a fascinating look at a brilliant young man coming into his own in a time that doesn't seem prepared for him, and Schamus handles the material with the respect it deserves.",1
57321, Does any comedy director have a deeper bench of great actors than Christopher Guest?,1
169261," If the script's conflation of delicate conditions is never quite as outrageous or unsettling as its creator intends, Prevenge is still filled with moments that show Lowe's skill as a director and as an actress.",1
147814, The film is underwhelming but does carry strong performances.,1
233811, Entertaining if slightly pointless ...,1
64940," Abrahamson is a filmmaker with a nuanced sense of tone, and he handles the shift from surreal comedy to something deeper and more complex with a typically deft touch.",1
15319, The level of enjoyment one might get from a film about the film industry is probably exponentially based on one's own interest or involvement within the film industry.,1
57777, 'He Named Me Malala' would have been a much-improved film if (director Davis) Guggenheim had been more objective and given us a fuller and deeper portrait of this extraordinary and exquisite role model.,1
122166," The aggregate effect is like aesthetic insulin shock, albeit from an artificial sweetener.",0
5297," One of these days Statham is going to realize that he needs to change things up a bit or get someone to start choosing better material for him. Until then, it seems he's doomed to be stuck in the rut he's dug for himself.",0
1994, The film's inability to decide whether it wants to be sweet and life-affirming or vicious and nasty creates not only a disconnect on the story level but results in tonal shifts that are dizzying.,0
121811," This would indeed be admirable, were it not for the shallow, pseudo-intellectual way in which the film approaches its subject, its characters, and by implication, its audience.",0

245149, Neither amusing nor interesting comedy about three couples starring in a documentary centered on marital discord. ,0
236732," Nothing happens, but everything happens; it is simple yet absorbingly profound. And it will resonate. It will resonate afterwards and it will resonate the next day and it will resonate the day after that.",1
177445," In Fink's script for The Last Word, Pellington finds the right vehicle to explore his preoccupations through a new lens, and addressing the issues through female characters has reinvigorated his technique.",1
114984," Eventually, the formalistic strictures of the documentary fall away and Polley - her entire family, really - is left facing the reality of the past as the cameras roll.",1
245788," As fascinating as it may be, the mystery is something of a red herring: Panahi is interested more in exploring the subtle dynamic between himself and Jafari...",1
251153," So corny, cheesy and second-rate, the infamous 1994 version isn't looking so bad after all.",0
45144," Incessantly bigoted views of a country and culture unfortunately comprise this unholy-and worse, unfunny-mess.",0
186821," Righteous Kill, a.k.a. The Al and Bob Show, is a cop flick with all the drama of Law and Order: AARP.",0
14773, Might as well be titled Misc Gangster Film #78253.,0
223528," Cherry blossoms, sweet bean paste & secrets are ingredients of this involving drama in which a confectioner, schoolgirl & elderly woman cross paths. Simply told with plenty of heart, the film explores the simple joys that relieve burdens & unite souls",1
170650," A stylish, tantalizing, and highly watchable film. Lindsay Lohan makes a scorching comeback.",1
4884," As in the episode with the engineer turned terrorist, where restitution of the family unit supersedes revolutionary politics, it's clear that Szifrón lacks Almodóvar's truly confrontational sensibility.",0
84632, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. It perfectly captures the unrelenting awfulness of the book it's based on. ,0
30074," What a wasted chance at, ahem, a bouncy start of the summer movie season.",0
248928," A film that you can't miss; and also, the new great hope of German cinema that deserves everything. [Full review in Spanish]",1
138947, ... there's the assembly-line predictability of it all.,0
186273," More intriguing than enthralling, more creepy than disturbing, The Night Listener runs a tidy 80 minutes yet still feels stretched.",0
30840," Comic book films cannot survive on action or spectacle alone, so it is some comfort to know that The Wolverine has a relatively solid script.",1
202915," Sincere, wholesome drama overcomes cliched plot. ",1
169427, Opts for raucous frivolity over genuine substance. But it's great fun while it lasts.,1
69790," Brutal fight choreography closer to the Bourne movies than ""Bad"".",1
179926," Florence couldn't hit the right note with a blunderbuss, but Streep's performance is pitch perfect.",1
127383," For all the controversy surrounding this film... the main talking point about Udta Punjab should be that it is, by far, one of the best-acted Bollywood films in the past few years. That alone is worth the price of your ticket.",1
34538, It's a spiritual journey about the timelessness of true love. And it's a journey better not taken.,0
29261," Bereft of engaging characters or dialogue, it lurches from one blood-splattered action sequence to the next, even threatening viewers with a sequel at the end.",0
123131, It's a two-hour therapy session with lots of firepower. What a blast.,1
192427," Loach may be best known for staunchly political films like Bread and Roses, but in many ways Sweet Sixteen is a throwback to his other pictures, grittier slice-of- life films like My Name Is Joe.",1
63264," Not quite as bad as 1, still very bad.",0
129478, I've included this in my little list that I've added to Dante's Nine Circles of Hell...the punishment is that those unfortunates are condemned to watching this society of films on a loop over and over again for all eternity. ,0
188911, Watts ... delivers one of those tour-de-force deals you often read about but rarely see.,1
183583," It's notoriously difficult to balance lighthearted humor with the spookiness a good ghost story requires, but director Rob Minkoff is surprisingly successful, delivering a satisfying mix of laughs and mild scares aimed at a young audience.",1
96483," ...hysterical stuff, even if it only hints at the creative level Wilson and Anderson would reach next with Rushmore.",1
30588," While the gabby grossout ensemble lounges about providing more mutually supportive laugh tracks than actual laughs, rotund mother-in-law flatulence jokes abound to presumably fill in the creative void, wouldn't you know it.",0
212733," [Director Chloe] Zhao and her films are worth discovering, and The Rider is a welcome surprise.",1
184270," Like so many films these days, this one turns out to be more interesting when you get away and think about it.",1
185615, Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them is to the Harry Potter franchise what The Phantom Menace was to Star Wars. And that does not bode well.,0
93363," Enthralling, suspenseful, thrilling and refreshingly witty. A much-needed breath of fresh air. Bravo to Patty Jenkins! Note to Hollywood: please hire more women to direct blockbusters. ",1
39204," While it certainly has more gunplay and kung-fu hijinks ... it is ultimately less entertaining, despite the likeable leads.",1
41293," The film wants to replicate the earlier films moral arc, but ends up playing to the double standards it's trying to combat.",0
128147," Mystery, Alaska has affection and understanding for small-time life.",1
73956, Harrison is too serious about this milieu; he seems to be making the suggestion that kids really have found party nirvana this time.,0
23605," ...a series of cliches strung together with a completely implausible comeback story and its funniest joke are the visuals that accompany the closing credits. The film is pleasant enough and a bit sweet, but it feels slapped together.",0
250865, A so-so idea and a good cast squandered on an eight-figure scramble of the movies and books of which writer-director Drew Pearce is fond. It's depressing to see so little of Jodie Foster anymore. Why does she keep making dunderheaded dystopian duds?,0
127641, The film doesn't know whether to take itself seriously or play it for laughs.,0
66315," [At] a certain point no amount of blue, red, orange, yellow and white color motifs can hide a tired narrative that continually drifts of into sentimentality so ripe you can smell it three screening rooms away.",0
186431, Dave Chappelle's Block Party is easily the most fun I've had in a movie theater in months.,1
244074," Pacific Rim Uprising aspires to be mindless entertainment and mostly succeeds, thanks to vigorous direction from first-timer Steven S. DeKnight and a reasonably charismatic star, John Boyega.",1
53659," A warm, glossy holiday fable that hits some surprisingly sweet notes.",1
46341, Song of the South's cartoon sequences are as fine as anything produced by the Disney animators.,1
39345, In director Marielle Heller's Can You Forgive Me? Melissa McCarthy delivers one of the best on-screen portraits of a writer because she nails real-life scribe Lee Israel's torment.,1
9300," Dumb & Dumber has its fans, and they've been eagerly waiting 20 years for this sequel. But they're mistaken if they think this movie was produced for them.",0
47518, Ryan takes advantage of the fact Stallone is a solid character actor who got waylaid into stardom.,1
89382," This is no graphic shoot-'em-up but an intelligent, if sometimes sentimental, exploration of human decency and responsibility that ponders the limits of rationality and faith.",1
88639," Both the originality and stirring emotional complexity of ""Monsters, Inc.,"" with its exquisitely painful and touching parallels with the human world, are missing ...",0
161321," A persuasive thriller for most of its length, it stumbles in its attempt to become an upscale version of Death Wish and other vigilante dramas and ends up derailing with a soft thud.",0
188435, Captures the complex weave of life in contemporary China...,1
100115," Most of Hancock's faults can be forgiven because Will Smith creates a quintessentially American hero: flawed, frayed, but always sacrificing for the sake of others.",1
131606, The much loved Ethan Hawke finds himself in a cheap and cheerless horror film watching images of murders and trying to find the boogie-man before the bad acting around him causes him too much grief.,0
65935," Shot and edited with verve and brio, but that story...",0
50506, Paul Blart: Mall Cop is like the many variations on tuna surprise that show up at potlucks: generic but with a little something added to differentiate it.,1
88311, An example of how good intentions don't necessarily make for a good movie.,0
158872," He certainly never shuts up, and he never stops joking; he's a neurotic narcissist to whom a war and a country's misery mean little except how they affect him personally.",0
50441," Features a plot anyone over 16 has seen at least a dozen times, with slick but completely unoriginal directing by Matthew Vaughn.",0
17486," Hard to Be a God is such a singular anomaly that it's tempting to suspend any value judgment. I felt as much overwhelmed, oppressed, exhausted by it as bewitched, and I wonder how many viewers its genuinely hermetic brilliance will connect with.",1
39588," Cheerful enough, but it really doesn't tell us terribly much beside the fact that Doyle has seen a lot of the same movies we all have.",0
42240," Sex and drugs in stale, raunchy romcom. ",0
28697, I can't remember the last time I saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one.,1
224579, It's the supposedly urgent investigation that somehow fails to keep up its momentum. ,0
32392," ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" the exuberant new movie from David O. Russell, does almost everything right.",1
136143, You can't not like The Rock.,0
116376," Shallow and conventional, Amelia, yet another version of the legendary aviatrix, is a total misfire, unfolding as a narrated photo album with plot that's all turning points but no real substance, fully fleshed characters or significant issues.",0
181997," This is a music video; an ego piece for two fading stars that is one of the most creatively bankrupt pieces of cinema in years. Actually, most music videos are better. ",0
8149," It's a sometimes pleasing, and often unsettling movie, proof that Almodovar still has a playful side, but let's hope he goes back to work soon.",0
182138, One of those motley movies that borrows from just about everywhere.,0
118731, The Man Who Shot Hitler is a high-quality spectacle.,1
220978," With lyrical intelligence and scrappy wit, Coppola creates a luscious world to get lost in. It's a pleasure.",1
221654," If the film is at all autobiographical, maybe writer/director Gavin Wiesen is remembering seeing 2008's ""The Wackness,""...or 2006's ""Art School Confidential,"" ...",0

189634, Less than impressive film.,1
154770," For a person so extreme, so inactive, so broken, simply asking God for help isn't enough. He writes because he can no longer pray. A commanding performance and a uniquely incredible script.",1
244981," What it lacks in simplicity of narrative, The Assassin expertly makes up for in its presentation.",1
239900," Gyllenhaal brings every ounce of his physical self to the role, but rippling muscles and a mashed-up face don't really constitute a performance. It's not quite his fault that Billy is such a maddening character.",0
155630, Surprisingly rollicking and resonant ...,1
214294," How Iñárritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga seamlessly link these four stories makes for an unconventional film experience that is weighty, thought-provoking and riveting.",1

103447," After Columbine, this dark comedy isn't as funny.",1
210853," Butler's presence makes perfect sense. He's an empty, mindless vessel. Just like his movie.",0

144172," Yes, this groaner retreads the ground of the middling-at-best 1968 movie of the same name.",0
164227, The movie does little to elucidate the experiences and suicidal personality of a singer who was more of a poseur than a musician.,0
114472," Other than an unconvincing Tom Cruise, this is interesting and well done, especially if you are among the apparent multitudes who don't know anything about this event.",1
52037," Such a vivid and minute portrait of our boho-chic, mid-century modern, reclaimed wood, custom typography, shrub-swilling, microgreens-on-heirloom-quinoa moment that the characters can be outlines, and it doesn't really affect the ride.",1
222803, Overly stylized and not-so-thrilling train ride is ultimately merely average at best and will disappoint fans looking for anything more.,0
249627, The greatest trick of Colaizzo's winning comedy: it doesn't need that cheese factor to inspire plenty of tears and cheers.,1

30913," I'll bet you think that Iceland is one of the world's happiest, most civilized places. This dramedy uses wry humor and deadly conflict to ratchet the suspense and counteract your trust.",1

233855," A surreal thriller that is sometimes creepy, sometimes sweet, but consistently spellbinding. ",1
148355, Deliriously inventive and sadistically cruel.,1
228762, While the comedy has its amusing elements the knuckleheaded tone of most scenes prevents the film from generating much real wit.,0
15508," There are some giggles here, but most of them are coming from Streep as she goes through her litany of coy indecisiveness ending with the desired reaction.",0

14801, Basir and co-writer Samantha Tanner can only arrive at generalities about the situation and these people.,0

96094," When the new animated movie focuses on the critters, it's a funny trip through the animal kingdom. What slows the ark (oops, make that arc) of the film is a crime story that's in need of a few more monkeyshines.",1
238676," The film feels pity for the exhausted city of London. The vast metropolis was the scene of greatness during World War II, but a few years later, it is drab, hungry and without optimism.",1
197713," The plot staggers from absurd to ridiculous, and the dialogue is strictly of the 'Look we don't have to go down there' variety.",0
76233," Is it mean? Gratuitously prankish? On the surface, sure, but it serves to remind the viewer that Maher is very well aware of his own presence and purpose.",1
202696, The movie suffocates as scene after shouty scene delivers nothing except yet another variant of the notion that it's a bummer to lose a loved one.,0
131950," The problem in the screenplay is its lack of imagination, oddly enough, which is demonstrated by repetition of the central idea - instead of a satisfactory development of it",0
184908," There's a little energy early in the picture, especially when we meet John's very unkempt relatives, but by the third act the thin premise becomes fully exhausted.",0

131967," It is so disturbing it makes you uncomfortable watching it. For the price of admission, you become an unwilling voyeur.",0
251929," Despite its tendency to blame India and China more than the wealthy Western nations for the Copenhagen climate change fiasco, the documentary is a solid examination of the truly catastrophic implications of uncontrolled greenhouse gases.",1
184511," Carrey finds the perfect outlet for his manic energy: Id and libido are fused, with Steven driven by actual lust and the unwavering -- and completely believable - determination to provide for his fragile boyfriend.",1

47278, The film itself tries sometimes too hard for laughs and at other times strains for shock.,0
230880, Most revenge thrillers have an element of the absurd inherent in the nameless thugs who get mowed down. Cold Pursuit just has the bravado to lean into the absurdity.,1

58346, The Commuter forfeits a good movie about why an everyman might get ensnared in some lite Hitchcockian mishegoss for a mediocre one about how he might weasel his way out of it,0
245976," The natural world shimmers with wonder and Arrietty's tiny domestic world is lovingly rendered. After the sometimes brash in-your-face dazzle of CGI, it's a delight to experience again the delicate, painterly charms of old-fashioned hand-drawn animation.",1
125330," For all its stylistic flourishes and interlocking storylines, Inglourious Basterds is, at its bullet-riddled core, a bloody good war movie, twisting and twisted and full of wordy shrapnel but no less kickass for it.",1

194428," Even if real fanboys are not pleased with some of the revelations (and, perhaps, not all should be believed), the major impact of The Force will go a long way in keeping everyone relatively happy. ",1
88707," For those who saw Meghie's stellar debut ""Jean of the Joneses,"" ""The Weekend"" is the proper follow-up, a brutally funny and whipsmart comedy that goes so many places that few others have, even though it is largely confined to one location.",1
61639," A preposterous exercise in high-minded brutality, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" tries to pass itself off as a dialectic on justice betrayed, but instead plays like a snuff film with our nation's legal system as the victim.",0
133902," Fun, funny, gory and yet still strangely romantic.",1

65166," A Good Day to Die Hard is pointless and joyless, a barrage of noise and chaos, an onslaught of destruction without the slightest mention of consequence.",0
117027, Its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which you can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked.,1
106456, Proves all the more insane that it equates Secretariat to a Jesus Christ-like messiah.,0
229245," A lively, realistic tone helps make this Toronto-set comedy much more than we expect, stirring in some thoughtful themes and honest emotion.",1
69648," Darnell Martin races through the script's bullet points with a brisk superficiality that leaves crucial plot points underdeveloped and unresolved, and refuses to engage the dark side of Leonard Chess' paternalism.",0
112323, Considering Beatrix in her heart of hearts wanted people to just sit back and enjoy themselves while reading her books it seems to me that a film about her life doing the same would be perfectly apropos.,1

140269, Redford fans will delight in this flick. Everything that made him a star is out in full force here.,1
213917," It's possible, I suppose, that Dunne and Wittenborn were so intent on excoriating the well-to-do that they conceived of this entire movie as an act of self-flagellation. In which case, they should rest assured that no one stands to make a dime from it.",0

36794," It's a decent movie, though sometimes becomes a bit sugary, and it's not clear if the comedy is supposed to be rooted in realistic observation or sentimental feelgoodery.",1
212675," First-time director Dan Gilroy maintains a good pace throughout the film. It works on every level as drama, social commentary, action. The cinematography by Oscar-winner Robert Elswit is excellent. ",1

70016," A dry and honorable retelling of events that exists mostly to remind us who she was, and why any potential whistleblowers out there should honor her example.",1
75329," A cynical political thriller about reckless TV journalists-turned-bounty hunters, highlighting the absurdity of war.",1
188407," Appropriately, the sequel suffers from almost the same problems as the original: while it's visually dazzling, thematically intriguing and fronted by the single coolest man in the universe, it's also empty, derivative and rather directionless",1

74058," While the film's ending is, quite literally, overkill, this poetic and unexpectedly tender film is mesmerizing from start to finish. Lets hope they don't screw up the inevitable American remake too badly...",1
52128," Hill has been mulling The Assignment's story since the 1970's, and that in itself may prove a cautionary tale: If it's taken you almost 50 years to finally get your story made into a movie, it probably wasn't that great of a story to begin with.",0

22272, This movie's premise is high concept and would be easy to dismiss were the film not so flawlessly executed.,1
100396," The first film's main problem dogs this one as well: A dull story. The villain is big and loud, and Banner has a good heart, but neither makes for an interesting character.",0

105708, A story that kicked off two years ago at a reasonable gallop has now slowed to barely a limp.,0
202843," Giuseppe Tornatore's sprawling, epic family drama is well acted and beautifully shot, but it's also much too long and lacks narrative focus.",0

208582, It's a humane and empathetic treatment that Chubbuck might have endorsed.,1
233391," Skyscraper is the action movie at its most generic, but not at its most fun. It should be a movie that gives us larger-than-life action with a fanciful building and Johnson's charisma, but instead it gives us neither.",0
41827," Often a filmmaker of great visual energy, Lelio becomes slave to the depressing winter aesthetic of the film's surroundings, draining the film of any passion or style. ",0

7294, In Jackson Heights is a work by that rarest of creatures: someone with an unbridled love for humanity.,1
241223," The camera work seems to be used as a metaphor for Van Gogh's descent into madness, visually expressing his manic states by jostling the camera to the point of causing motion sickness in the viewer. Willem Defoe, however, is in top form. ",0

243918, An absorbing character study that teases some vicarious revenge on a perfidious member of the billionaire's club.,1

224807, The movie is truly a tree-hugger's delight (I confess to being one such hugger) that makes the most of its metaphors without straining toward supernatural schmaltz.,1
134810," Ultimately ""Jackie"" isn't that different from ""Manchester by the Sea."" Both films deal with bottomless torment, but also with the way the death of a loved one brings headaches big and small. ",1
245864," Left to her own devices, Gerwig has arrived and solidified her place as one of the most invigorating, observant and authentic voices in movies today with a director's acumen to match.",1
159590," So all of this critical foam about how The Winter Soldier is highly political with its internet leaks and whistleblowers is just the scum on the glass after a refreshing egg cream-a leftover, a thing to wash off.",0

48125, Any issues with the material are made irrelevant by Denzel Washington's volcanic energy and fierce conviction.,1
163603," As a really mindless action-movie, Cellular's not bad. It's even moderately diverting. But it's certainly nothing to call home about. ",0

46691, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance is out to ruin you.,1

157123," The requisite standoffs and shootouts make this one tense film, but the mood is frequently lightened with a generous dose of surprising humor.",1
197560," It's amazing how distinctive and strange Mermaid manages to be, especially given the highly derivative concept - how personal it feels, amid all the absurdist, go-for-broke humor. It deserves to be seen.",1
115182," God's Pocket, despite its tiptop cast, fails to sustain its comedy or drama. It becomes, at best, a piece of sardonic anthropology.",0
43710, Wallows in fat jokes and wink-wink nudge-nudge references that anybody with even a passing knowledge of cinema history will find eye-rollingly obvious. ,0
238021, The movie regales us with the heroics of a (mostly) white American platoon picking off anonymous black savages.,0
60035," It even has something like a brain with awareness of the world outside the film, and that is too rare of a commodity in American film comedy in the 2010s.",0
31746," I know I stand alone on this, but Kristy Swanson is the one true Buffy.",1
133860, The story feels watered down and less powerful.,0

212483," [T]erribly earnest and, as a result, terribly dull...",0
134077," Present-day interviews and modern re-enactments provide the piece with its structure, but it's the awe-inspiring archival footage that makes this a giddy watch.",1
13287," From one hallway to the next and from room to room, [Philippe Van Leeuw] turns a home and its inhabitants into the center of the most complicated look at human conduct. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
31805," A serious contender for the best film of 2017, the only way to watch Dave McCary's Brigsby Bear is the way it was made: with a completely open heart.",1
38945, At least five years late and a few million brain cells short.,0
181784, I especially enjoyed the scenery in England and the atmosphere around Wimbledon.,1
225401," The thing that ultimately makes it a classic in the pantheon of American movies is the way it reveals something about the idealism, strength, grace and grit of the American Dream.",1
134086," A smart, surprisingly thought-through blockbuster, with a decent grasp of the theological implications of its idea.",1
8262, A teen-movie milestone that tackles the uncomfortable issue of racism in an engaging and relatable way.,1
190160," Simply a good time, rollicking as it revels in one Brinkley exploit after another.",1
126641," There are far worse horror movies than Puppet Master: The Littlest Reich, including its inspiration. But even though it's marginally better than the 1989 launch, its competence only goes so far.",0
86651," Blessedly, Were-Rabbit is as much fun to watch as it must have been to write.",1
1101, ...a spiritually spry yet lumbering fantasy...The technological flourishes are a marvel to behold but the film's erratic journey is as choppy as a country dirt road,0
106869, It makes a dull movie out of a fascinating piece of history.,0
31038, Neither Han Solo nor The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part are entirely [Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's] creations... [and] can't be blamed or praised for 100 percent of the results. [Full review in Spanish],1
137828," Mostly, ""Fifty Shades of Black"" is exactly what you expect it will be.",0
104167, Legacy is a fine pseudo-reboot--mostly setup but good enough to warrant a sequel to see what Gilroy and Renner come up with next.,1
91057," The Never-ending Story between Arabs and Jews gets another wryly humorous workout, marbled with personal sadness and mystification, in The Time That Remains.",1
218054," Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy is well acted by Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. (in an Oscar-winning turn), but as a tale of redemption, the movie is not too deep and goes out of its way to satisfy viewers' expectations of a happy ending.",1
30334, You probably never thought there would be a cross between Woody Allen's Zeilig with Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump. Still less that it would be a Swedish black comedy.,1
231463," The grief of displacement and financial inadequacy is real and devastating and informs much of Little Men, but so too does the equally authentic exhilaration of young friendship in the big city.",1
243555," Joyeux Noel has its share of bloodshed, but the movie is about a respite from carnage.",1
129458," Smart, funny, emotionally affecting -- if maybe a little overstuffed -- film anchored to interesting characters is much better than you've perhaps been led to believe. ",1
7221, ...manages to remain entertaining in spite of the lackluster script.,1
19390," In the tradition of recent Hollywood sequels, this one replays the old gags, gooses up the pace and lowers the level of the humor -- way lower.",0
169272," I've never seen anything quite like it, and though it doesn't all work for me, its central message of liberty and agency is as inspiring as it gets.",1
161786," The screenplay is patchy and inconsistent, and provides few chuckles.",0
82705," Utterly harmless and totally sweet-natured, visually sophisticated and imaginative but narratively closer to Teletubbies than its source material -- which is to say that if you're over the age of four, it's pretty dull.",0
220857, What gives the film its more lasting poignancy is Talley's discussion of growing up in an African-American community in North Carolina.,1
28958," Factory Girl, a biography of Edie Sedgwick, the most glamorous of Andy Warhol's so-called superstars, suggests a magazine layout masquerading as a film.",0
56489," Even though the cinematic foundation of this cheap prefab fluff is a message of family togetherness, the building materials -- boneheaded behavior, overwrought conflict, treacly sentiment -- have classic dry rot.",0
238382," What sets Pixar's films apart is the studio's ability to embrace the darkness, dread and possibility of failure Dory faces. That's what brings Finding Dory close to the heights of Finding Nemo. ",1
104698," This is Spielberg's masterpiece, a near perfect film directed with astonishing skill and unafraid to get sentimental ... without crossing the line into syrup.",1
142327," You're either on board with what Twohy was trying to achieve here or not. Unfortunately, suspension of disbelief only can go so far.",0

155372, Charming and entertaining thanks to a surprisingly endearing performance by Jimmy Fallon. ,1
139856," There are scads of scabrous inside-Hollywood psychodramas, but never a festering pyre on the order of David Cronenberg and Bruce Wagner's Maps to the Stars. What a hyperfocused duo of ghouls!",1
2157, It's an episode of Red Shoe Diaries with a major studio budget. It's a Lifetime movie with insider art pretensions. A Harlequin romance with anal play.,0
92365," Heard through lively 1990 interviews, Lamarr describes a career that objectified her and a brilliance that wasn't recognised, let alone rewarded, until late in her life",1
249896," You used to be able to count on Oliver Stone for a good shot or two of cinematic adrenaline. So, who would have thought he'd choose to present one of the most controversial figures of the 21st Century as warm, fuzzy, and more than a bit boring?",0
181302," An audience looking for a Star Wars-like fix, albeit with wands and rings instead of light sabres, is sure to offer a healthy return.",1
219935, Action trumps plot in Hong Kong director Dante Lam's latest thriller about brothers fighting the release of a mutant smallpox virus.,0
189452, What We Started hauls out some of EDM's biggest guns for this solid documentary overview of dance-music DJs.,1

223922," A fascinating exercise in nonfiction filmmaking as a performative, interdisciplinary, collective act, as well as a provocative inquiry into how selective memory, ideology, shame and unspeakable trauma shape what we come to accept as official history.",1
81343," Don't be fooled by the period costumes and British accents, Hysteria is as obvious and pandering as comedies get.",0
120275, Horrible Bosses is a sloppy  film that wants to be an edgy black comedy but doesn't come close to pushing the envelope enough.,0
78906," The genre's usual framing perspective gets a kick in the pants in this boozy, femme-centric coming-of-age flick that chiefly connects courtesy of a nervy, burgeoning adult performance by Kristen Stewart, and a smart, economical sense of period style.",1
204224," Nearly every major character dies and comes back to life at least once and a convoluted narrative yields not a single, palpable moment of drama.",0
193402," The kind of movie destined to become the answer to the rhetorical question, ""With a cast this good, how bad can it be?""",0
3963," Dispiritingly bland gothic nonsense, more concerned with gloomy atmosphere and trite adolescent angst than with creating a compelling story.",0
16707, Captured the imagination of a generation on the cusp of a musical and social cataclysm.,1
103858," Gorgeous imagery.Beautifully wrought special effects. Fantasy fun for all ages.I'm talking , of course, about 'The Last Airbender' website.",0
106635," Vitali's story, wrapped in fascinating details about what it was like backstage in Kubrick productions, is a must-see for fans of the great director and anyone else enchanted with the inner workings of the film industry.",1
233601," This is Bell's show, and she proves herself a versatile comedian, a first-rate impressionist (check out her Russian ""Star Wars"" stormtrooper!) and a shrewd satirist, especially of her own gender.",1
179676," The concept is kind of funny.Christopher Walken is kind of funny.The only thing wrong with the movie is that it isn't funny, and that's bad news for a comedy.",0
34975, This debut feature could be a first sketch for an American version of Mike Leigh's work.,1
140144," Beyond the incomprehensible battles, one might find a thoughtful deglamorization of the legend; a gritty, tough movie that shows a surprising willingness to traffic in ideas.",1
144794," One more bloated effects-o-rama lumbering through a formula plot without much zest, imagination or awareness of its own absurdity.",0
182392, What is there not to like about watching a bad guy get knocked off of his speeding motorcycle by a giant Pez dispenser bouncing down the road?,1
168655," For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects, the new Star Wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one.",0
16563," So when you sit in this movie and can count on one hand the number of times you laugh, it's disappointing, especially when it's the same joke repeated over and over and over again.",0
198929, I wish Phantom Menace was a better film. The bones of a great film are there. But there's no beating the sense of hope and adventure and honest-to-goodness wonder that shines through.,1
121077, Watching Dogtown is like discovering a secret history of America.,1
82975, A finely sketched portrait of the artist's unlikely pursuit of perfection.,1
210752, A spiritual movie for practicing empathy and compassion for fearful fundamentalists.,1
86555," It's a mean, potent little movie.",1
209828, It's rare to see a film about music that professes its love for the music and its characters equally.,1
77174," A brilliant take on a sport that has the surface appearance of machismo. The film reveals a much more feminine side, complete with hair removal and posing.",1
40066," As irritating as this film is, I am grateful for it. Reygadas is an artist, and an uncompromising one at that.",0
116868," Toothless' initial flirtation with the Light Fury is a wondrous bit of wordless, physical comedy.",1
223762, ...the almost total lack of substance ensures that most viewers will have an awfully hard time finding much here to embrace...,0
167974, Black Butterflies is the sad human poetry of the lost souls who slip beneath the waves to echo in our collective consciousness.,1
236246," It's a miracle: A tough, honest, bloody film set so far from the bright lights it feels as if it's on a different planet, yet knowable and absolutely compelling from start to finish. Fargo is great American movie-making.",1
215070, Genesis 2.0 shows that both Russian and South Korean scientists are hellbent on bringing back the woolly mammoth.,1
241993," Silverman delivers a knockout performance - any memories of her scatalogical stand-up act are washed away in an instant. But her intense commitment to the depths of depression belongs in a better, more focused, less derivative film.",0
66591," Zombie has talent to burn, but he's slumming here, and one suspects that he knows it.",0
176341, nothing more than a ninety minute car commercial,0
10524," Perry may never make a movie for the masses, whoever they are. But his truest work burrows into weird, blackly comic places few other filmmakers would dare explore.",1
74479," In its quieter moments, Wonderstruck occasionally approaches the transcendent, sublime quality Haynes is aiming for-but those times are frustratingly few and far between.",0
18581," ""Addicted"" doesn't know whether it wants to be a modern-day bodice-ripper, a morality-tinged cautionary tale or a serious snapshot of sexual compulsion. Whatever the case, it fails on all fronts.",0
203537, It's Pixar's first clunker.,0
73660," A triumph of nuance that imagines something from a source of simplicity and then wraps it in a cloak of wonderment, despair, alarm and sometimes outright horror.",1
237185, A film of uncommon naturalism that offers a rare cinematic glimpse -- at least outside of documentaries -- into the lives of the working poor.,1
69784, Kaufman is full of ideas but doesn't know when to quit.,0
112663," Jonathan Demme makes his third concert film with Young, including shots practically right up his nostrils.",1
63781, Fundamentally unreal and contrived.,0
13030, Mendes digs into suburban life with a riveting and ultimately stark marital drama.... And it's the terrific acting that keeps us engaged.,1
120077, Doesn't offer enough occasions for real spontaneous laughter to justify the cost of a full-price ticket.,0
114071," President Evil is frankly not a good movie. Like many films that mix two genres, in this case, comedy and horror, you ultimately water down the two producing a mediocre final product.",0
53236, The ending will have you switching off your Netflix app in disgust. If you don't die from boredom before you get there.,0
56871, The emotions seem almost as manufactured as the sets.,0
228307," If it's laughs you are after, however unintentional, this movie provides all the precious morsels. Starting with the idea that anyone felt the need to make it.",0
94259," The movie is violent and alarming, but in no way does it endorse or glamorize killing as a solution to problems. When the inevitable murders begin in the third act, no one is going to be cheering for more.",1
174497," It runs 140 minutes, and wears out its welcome",0
166110, Irons' performance as the tormented twins is a tour de force. So is Cronenberg's complex camera work.,1

102568," Kagawa's simpering malevolence fulfils the title's promise right up to his last, sly leer.",1
246585, An impressive hybrid.,1
82851," What we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant, self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on Skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value.",0
58767," A black comedy as dry and deadpan as a bleached skull. To this end, the movie opens with a sort of death's-head grin: an in-your-face closeup of the grille of a stretch limousine...",1
165441, A deeply immersive exercise in low-budget suspense from start to finish. ,1
27085, Yet another film created for the lowest common denominator in all of us.,0
241999," It may not boldly go where no one has gone before, but Star Trek Beyond recaptures the essence that some were feared lost, a hopeful and optimistic tale full of adventure and fun. It's not perfect, but it feels necessary.",1
58003, A one note affair about the ravages of war in which beautiful people are dirtied up and walk around idyllic landscapes while bad things happen all around them...,0
65038," The movie, rather admirably isn't black and white about the issues it raises.",1
49210," Engrossing, suspenseful and quietly haunting with exquisite cinematography and meticulous attention to detail.",1
58011," Thrillers in which seemingly harmless outsiders worm their way into safe, secure, middle-class homes and then threaten them were popular in the '90s; this one feels like a pale copy. ",0
61381, There's nothing to do but shake your head in awestruck wonder: as much for its squandered beginning as for its truly ridiculous conclusion.,0
49908," Made of Honor is like a paint-by-the numbers exercise in filmmaking, sealed with a misogynistic lacquer.",0
121365," ""Heli"" is a slow, but unrelenting look at one young man's punishing loss of innocence amongst a society that has already decayed beyond understanding.",1
195469," Going in Style is that most irksome, instantly forgettable of films -- a remake that fails to make the case for not leaving well enough alone. It also fails to offer its cast material worthy of its talent.",0
222737," manages to maintain much of the book's heady philosophical weight, albeit primarily by changing as little as possible from the source material",1
96721," ""A Separation"" could hardly be more concrete, or contemporary, or dramatic.",1
81521, Having Captain Jack Sparrow step onto the scene would have been far more believable.,0
20944," Ultimately, ""Chappie"" is about someone whom you know to have better instincts that you hope win out in the end. After this, you'll feel the same about Blomkamp. It's the kind of bad from which he can bounce back ... but damn, does it hurt to watch.",0
47609," Adam Sandler stars in a watchable movie so, yes, there's a miracle involved. Sandler tamps down the moron act to play Max Simkin, a Bronx cobbler with a magical stitching machine that enables him to transform into his customers by slipping on their shoes.",1
33544," The whole deal with the Grinch is he is supposed to be, if you'll forgive me, a seemingly irredeemable bastard. He literally lacks the capacity for any kind of love. If he's just kind of a crabby neighbor everything is less impressive in juxtaposition.",0
168066," While undeniably outrageous at times, Bleak Street also takes its protagonists and their plights seriously. Like many of Ripstein's previous films, there is real grit and dirt within his desaturated poverty-riddled scenarios.",1
1328, Pushing Tin overshoots the runway by the equivalent of at least one of the Brothers Charles' better tv episodes.,0
18536," ""Inside Out"" expands the possibilities of animation. It's also a hilarious ride that delights the eye, the mind and the heart.",1

240640," Autism is often misunderstood, and through this intimate storytelling, we are given an insider's view from the parents,",1
241760," Every short may not be a winner (like all anthology films), but Tales Of Halloween is a unique little indie treat worth a light-hearted holiday watch this October.",1
130402," As the imprisoned Belle, Emma Watson is a prisoner of her own limited range, unable to transform her book-smart character into the sort of formidable romantic partner that could help the film overcome some of its more inherently dodgy sexual politics.",0
6628, A lovely surprise.,1
75199, One of the world's top disturbing tourist attractions is now finally getting the spooky film it deserves ,1
21717, A surprisingly thoughtful and beautifully shot film that doubles as both a history of and a love letter to the humble typewriter.,1
90923," Built around Bardem's immobile presence, the film can't help but seem stolidly monumental even as it explores issues that are heart-wrenchingly personal.",0
161332, A boring and distancing affair!,0
214600," Instead of articulating injustice or honestly portraying the legal system, North Country seems content with exploiting humiliation for effect.",0
91183, Aches with noble intentions and laudable aspirations. Watching it fail to come to fruition creates a similar ache in the viewer. ,0
121719, Movies twice as long are often half as eloquent.,1
248918," It has more to say than its predecessor, but the message gets jumbled in the process, leaving viewers wanting more-or at least a little more breathing room.",0
147466," Mumbled and intentionally impenetrable, the effort is a taxing sit with enormously skillful screen elements, molded into an interpretive shocker that's often not worth the time to unravel. ",0
232000," Ship of Theseus can be didactic as it nudges audiences toward environmental harmony and economic justice, but it's never preachy or sanctimonious. The credit for that balanced tone goes to its actors, who put real people at the core of these moral tales.",1
27193," The Apparition is not a great or even good haunted-house movie, but it does have the advantage of a memorable setting.",0
124273," Gemma Bovery is a mashup of Flaubert and a tired, outdated sex farce.",0
187431, An uplifting portrait of a debilitated man driven to excel by a relentless desire to live life and love those who surround him.,1
30866," It is always provocative, often clinical, rarely titillating. However, the film itself is so much more than that, that it would be unfair to rate it purely on its sexual content.",1
245936," The original dystopic movie, the first sci-fi epic; Lang's skilful juxtaposition of Germanic gothicism with Art Deco resulted in a brilliant motion picture, a classic in every sense.",1
72569, Godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess...In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating.,0
139581, By far the silliest and most self-mocking of the series.,1
167765," There are a few moments where the romance is overdone, and the film verges on being too sentimental, but those scenes are saved by the sweet performances of its cast.",1
170480, Good acting lends some balance to director's liking for sermons.,1
69379," Roger Michell's film is a straight forward romantic comedy, refreshingly strong on the latter and sparing with the former.",1
200368, Presents a story as insightful as it is harrowing.,1
79808," Audiences of all ages will warm to this delightful tale that is all at once a road movie, a coming of age story and one about a young boy longing for his father's approval",1
77217," That the filmmakers point towards menopause as the cause of some truly awful behavior is disturbing, but Karin Viard's powerhouse of a performance goes a long way towards easing that sting.",1
87665, An earnest and well-made character-based horror flick that's simply not all that interesting.,0
212215, Lakeview Terrace waves bye-bye much earlier on than it should and that's a shame because it would have been so nice to see such lofty reflections getting along in a thriller for mass consumption.,0
43924," You can detect a flicker - one might even say a ghost - of an interesting idea beneath its polished shell. But at every turn, Ghost in the Shell sacrifices the opportunity to actually say something interesting.",0
126010," Despite the outstanding performances and visuals, ""A Monster Calls"" is seriously too dark to be entertaining. It's much too traumatizing for children, and I don't know why adults would choose to see it, either. ",0
246434," Tautou, eschewing her usual smiley charm, is a revelation, and Miller's final film a fine testimony to his art.",1
158286, Mildred Pierce is a noir melodrama that served as a comeback film for waning star Joan Crawford...,0

137085," Ice Age: The Meltdown leaves you with a warm feeling, and not the typical frustration at being ripped off by a cheesy sequel.",1
91406," The Brothers Bloom may look slight, but as the intricate tricks and twists of it unfold, all of the cunning and cons in it reveal a sincere, beating heart behind the flash and fun.",1
21851, Campillo's film has a furious forward momentum that's inspired by the determination of its characters and bolstered by Arnaud Rebotini's house-music score.,1
240542," It's a soft-focus picture of a woman who, surely, had a few more hard edges, but it's a thoroughly pleasant escape to another world.",1
65707, To watch John Carter is to wonder where in this jumbled space opera one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe Stanton brought to Finding Nemo and Wall-E.,0
124295," A moderately suspenseful thriller that seems somewhat conventional compared to De Palma's earlier envelope-pushing efforts. Intriguing, but the mystery villain is rather obvious from the start.",1
77128," There is a real sweetness to this film, especially in Varda and JR's intergenerational chemistry, and its unfussy tone serves it well.",1
26276," In the chill of computerised battle, there's an important film in here somewhere.",1
184654," Frozen within the strictures of their shallowly conceived characters, Gadon and Powley do as best they can portraying those two semi-beautiful Windsor daughters.",0
171369," An interesting story alone isn't enough, and Tag struggles to turn its unique premise into an impressive full length feature.",0
137777," Blade Runner 2049 is a fantastic movie with bold ideas, visually stunning direction, and powerful performances. But underneath it all lies a Hollywood reboot.",1
162048," Whether it might have meant delving into grimmer thriller territory or bending toward more courageously incendiary humor, the finished cut screams out for a clearer, firmer, fuller vision.",0
212893," An inspired work, rich with clever satire and sly satiric references to our current political landscape.",1
63357," There are several times in the movie in which Neeson uses his wits instead of bullets to extricate himself from a difficult situation. In this kind of picture, that's called a plot twist.",0
216564," Like the Swiss clocks that must have watched over his editing suite, Polanski's flick ticks away relentlessly -- at 128 minutes, the film doesn't make us impatient for a second.",1
131550," Burma VJ would be even more intense without its early announcement that some scenes have been restaged, putting the viewer in a regrettably uncertain relationship to what follows.",1
118586," Just like the original Predator in 1987, co-writer/director Shane Black's franchise reboot succeeds on the slam-bang visceral level thanks to lashings of tough-guy machismo, spectacular stunts and gory dismemberment.",1

86848," What is this, anyway? Noir? Thriller? Fantasy? A bit of all three...whatever it is, it's the kind of movie that you come out of saying, ""What was that all about?""",0
102247," If the screenplay to ""Kill the Messenger"" were a news story, any capable copydesk would have kicked it back to the reporter-not for a shortage of facts, but a lack of dramatic soul.",0
31029," Engrossing for the reasons it's also unsatisfying: As Adam Shambour, a friend of Mr. Crowley's, says, it's a mystery that answers all the major questions except ""Why?""",1
220038," 21 is a mini-Ocean's Eleven about, and for, people who are the age of its title.",0
40586," This chilling documentary, executive produced by Werner Herzog and Errol Morris, has a twisted but illuminating point of entry.",1
225320," By drilling down into these two men and their conflict, Best of Enemies ends up having a lot to say about how we talk about politics and how we relate to -- and hate -- each other.",1
91875," Director Gavin Hood ... suffers from an ADD disorder when editing the action sequences. The cuts are too rapid, making it difficult to actually see who is doing what to whom.",0
193822, The film is so excited by the idea of itself that it never bothers to establish a rhythm.,0
160502," Like ""The Baader-Meinhof Complex"", this is a largely pointless exercise meant to deliver the same kind of cheap thrills as ""Bonnie and Clyde"" or the Mesrine flicks. At least with straight-ahead gangster movies, you don't get the liberal moralizing.",0
12510," The movie is very campy, but strangely, not very much fun.",0
48472," Though there are positive aspects of the film, this unnerving piece is tamer than most modern horror movies.",0
139905, The slippery nature of the morality on show coupled with the shifting sands of the narrative makes this an uneasy watch - yet it is also a beautiful and masterfully constructed film.,1

219521," Moana is solid ""retro Disney"" - a new film that embraces older ideas, themes, and narrative approaches.",1
133399," Leigh strikes an observational, artful tone that builds to an emotional climax as fittingly yet frustratingly enigmatic as anything that's come before.",1

41724, Darren Aronofsky reaches its zenith as director... making one of the most provocative films that has been seen in the commercial cinema in a long time. [Full review in Spanish],1

56504," I am aware that virtually every critic in America if not on the planet has lauded Hoffman's portrayal of the author and that I am in the minority. Watching Hoffman I felt something primal was missing from his interpretation ... To my mind, Hoffman's work",0
222622," A thinking person's action film with stylish fight scenes and a ""Bourne""-like existential core. ",1
74749," Nothing is straight forward in this film, when it ended I felt I knew something about David Lynch, but really know nothing.",1
68588," Formulaic but savvy reboot of the four-film series makes for a solid children's movie, bolstered by exotic locales and a genuinely talented young star.",1
230015," For all its gore and violence, stabs at tension and nightmarish intrigue, the film proves a slow-going, largely unsatisfying ride.",0
28758, The Green Inferno is less a riff on spaghetti splatter flicks like Cannibal Holocaust than a desperate-to-shock pastiche of guts and gore served with a wink to audiences with strong stomachs. You know who you are.,0
248739, The best drama of the year.,1
196951," McKinnon sports the worst Australian accent in the history of the acting profession, but it's still one of the best things about this no-class female version of Weekend at Bernie's Meets The Hangover. ",0
189418," What's been delivered here is a potent brew of psychological terror mixed with a genuinely spooky story, making The Babadook easily the best horror movie of recent years.",1
117979, There's such a fundamental sweetness and sensitivity at the core of Alexandra Shiva's documentary that it often doesn't matter that it's not profoundly insightful.,1
173294," The School of Rock is a high-energy comedy propelled by the antics of Joe Black as one who serves society by rocking and by sticking it to "" The Man.""",1
230689," Skyscraper could have been ridiculous fun! Or, it could have gone full-on '70s era dramatic disaster movie. Instead, it's somewhere in the middle and just kind of flounders.",0
237713, A rather twee romp that purposefully treads familiar ground with a predictability that will disinterest as many as it comforts.,0
9954," People who think of Scorsese only in terms of crime films sell him short, and they are the ones who will miss out on this thrilling, beautiful movie that believes we each have a place and a purpose, and true peace only comes from finding it.",1

46719," It's fitfully amusing, and only 80 minutes long.",1
43796, The movie's only mark of restraint is the absence of an earthquake.,0
52251, Payne's movie is one more love letter to imperfection that renews my affection for the predicament of being human.,1
149190," Branagh embraces a corny, old-fashioned tone that should make it stand out at the modern cineplex, but he's disappointingly inconsistent in rendering the movie lively.",0
118378," A colossal waste of time, a 14K dial-up in the time of fiber optic.",0
57111," Of course, it's annoying. But it's also funny, touching and true, striking chords without ever reducing Raymond to a performing puppy. Definitely.",1

240456," The movie has several surprising twists, and will tug gently at your heartstrings, a la Warren Beatty in the 1978 remake of ""Heaven Can Wait"".",1

197781," Characters are juicy and quirky and funny! The best first act I've seen on the screen in a long time. Imperfect, but a very good film. Alan Arkin is absolutely hilarious.",1
45905, I didn't care all that much about the implausibility or plot holes because the movie is start-to-finish fun.,1
97096, A thriller featuring a flirty May/December romance competing with a standard slasher horror film makes for a bad (and boring) combination.,0
50025," Director-writer Rob Burnett... deserves props for making such an offbeat, heartfelt film, and landing the talent to pull the lead roles off. It's just unfortunate that the film itself is not entirely successful.",0

67996, A daft plot seemingly jacked from the most brainless of Saturday morning cartoons.,0

66422," Director John Lee Hancock's only aiming for a crowd pleaser, and by not challenging the established playbook for inspirational sports dramas, he's no doubt got one.",0
5090," By playing with storytelling rules, almost to the point of madness, Satrapi has elicited sympathy for the devil.",1
218170," If not for Eva Green and her captivatingly insane portrayal of Artemisia, Rise of an Empire would be a failure as a sequel.",1

219764," It contains moments that suggest a genuinely original comic sensibility, but too often the film retreats into standard gross-out territory.",0

165132," My Friend Dahmer is nonetheless a sad film about squandered opportunity. Everybody is losing out in this grim, claustrophobic version of the late 1970s.",1
196246," A perfect title - all the essence and flavor of Mike Judge with very little of his substance. There's no trademark satirical vigor or vitriol - just a handful of good performances and inspired scenarios wasted on a treacly, halfhearted narrative.",0

169962," The film is not without merit, although it remains too much of a slow-burn to really catch fire as the gritty, medieval Euro western its set up promises.",1
5298, Jaw dropping stuff but you will have to have a strong stomach to cope with the constantly moving camera.,1
45941," A very powerful and confidently made movie, a film that really puts its audience through the wringer, which finally refuses any palliative gestures, with towering performances from Elba and Attah.",1
226205," Maybe it's the 'uncanny valley' factor, maybe it's the cheesy dialogue and maybe it's the lack of chemistry with relative newcomer Johnson, who doesn't have the charm or sparkle to carry the romantic lead role. Either way, the result is just awkward.",0
21819," The movie has some big laughs, yes, but never reaches takeoff velocity.",0
104683," The film still allows enough hope to compel me to watch the final chapter, and it's not so bad that I'm turned off all the ape sequels.",0
96387," What gives Saving Brinton its heart is watching one man work doggedly, without complaint, to save history. ",1

50787, A tremendously sensitive and complex portrayal of a forgotten star which forgoes caricature in favour of a deeply personal story.,1
241296," Midi Z directs another documentary with feature elements. His approach has many similarities to a road movie, particularly due to the episodic nature of the narrative, which aims at making a rather pointy comment regarding Buddhism and work immigrants ",1
28772," Like 2012 jacked up on both steroids and meth, there are no surprises to be had, no shades of grey, only the epic, the over the top and, at its brain-bursting best, the rollicking escape of a popcorn disaster flick.",1
115788," More of a romantic fantasy than a romantic comedy, ""Ghost Town"" may well prove to be the movie of the year for Those Who Believe.",1
27061, Intense acting doesn't save Furnce from the fires,0
95549, The filmmaking and performances in Allied are both capable. The problem lies in the story (or lack thereof) and its execution.,0

206854," Nick Ebeling's movie sets its sights on adulatory tribute, needlessly venerating films like ""The Last Movie"" and generally adorning Hopper's legacy with saintliness. ",0
54136," 45 Years may be annoyingly precise in its execution, but it's nuanced enough that it doesn't always matter, skillfully evoking literary antecedents like James Joyce's The Dead and Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway without being too fussy about it.",1
67436," The emotional conclusions here can be a little pat, and catharsis too easily come by. It's more cautiously sound-proofed than its title implies.",0
83673," Director Ang Lee has been quoted as saying he was making a Greek tragedy out of ""The Hulk"", not a superhero film. If that's true, he has succeeded.",1
18389," May the Saw mini-franchise, dulled into a bloody gore-fest bore after only three installments, rest in piece. A piece of hack-sawed-off foot here, a piece of a bludgeoned limb there.",0

176216," It's a tragic comedy in which the absurdity of the stoners' bad choices will find your funny bone. You will laugh and shake your head in mock disgust, because addicts are truly funny until they aren't anymore.",1
166931," One of the all-time great thrillers. Demme directs this for maximum suspense, yet the film also works as a multilayered feminist tale, with Foster's resourceful agent emerging as a beautifully conceived character.",1

2341," A perfectly adequate family film for kids who love watching things they've seen many times before (which is to say, most kids), it offers plenty of chuckles for their parents but nothing approaching the glee of that first Lego Movie.",1
119916," The film is all the more potent for its restraint, as constant on the mind as the cicadas that sound throughout the unyielding night.",1
250859," There's something to be said for a well-crafted motion picture, cinematically astute, that demands that we sit down and pay attention for a solid two hours or so, with no intermittent fridge runs.",1

16430," It's the complete opposite of the pushy, loud-mouthed, smart-alecky stuff that dominates children's cinema. ",1
145014," the setting in the decaying emptiness of a largely deserted suburban Detroit neighborhood gives the horror thriller an atmospheric sense of loss, abandonment, and desperation that greatly enhances its relatively rote trapped-in-a-house narrative",1

123987, Whereas too many Holocaust dramas rely on built-in sympathies and long-settled historical assumptions...Holland is not afraid to trade a barely-earned tear for a surprising tweak of our expectations.,1
83556," You know what you like from your horror movies better than I do, and I sincerely hope you enjoy the experience more than I did. If you need me, I'll be over here waiting for this cinematic universe to throw out a real curveball.",1
37217," In many ways, it feels like a romantic comedy from that era. But, the movie doesn't shy away from grittier real-life complications and adult language. ",1
71409, It's rife with disappointment and humiliation. But bleakness does not preclude buoyancy. It still manages to leave you with the urge to dance.,1
66444," Whether or not Betty sustains her character, the movie fails to maintain its own. The scenario falls apart.",0
130380," This story is one of a terrorist attack on the seat of government, but the only real danger presented is killing the audience's will to live by force feeding it a thin script so laden with clichés that it becomes a choking hazard",0
228819," As evocative as the production design and cinematography are, multiple cheesy scenes with one-dimensional characters undermine Howell's efforts to spook, let alone redefine a genre.",0
144965," ...a film as verbose as dynamic, where the camera accompanies the frenzy of the fight against time. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
246898, A film of some ragged charm -- and one in which there's always something cool to look at in design and filmmaking style. And that's more than a lot of movies can claim.,1

66400," Syd's would-be rebellion from this sick world is rendered toothless, largely because Cronenberg spends most of his film discussing how cool and complex the rules are, and how to break them.",0

135732," Even on a technical level, Robin Hood is impossible to follow anywhere.",0
41084, The movie squanders most of Dr. Seuss' idiosyncratic charm in favor of blaring overstatement.,0
27969," Buying that this girl would have trouble making friends, or snagging a genuine date to the dance, is even harder than pretending that a pair of glasses makes Rachael Leigh Cook look undesirable.",0
233592," Paris Can Wait revels in its embarrassment of riches in the French countryside, but the mature perspective of the 81-year-old Coppola gives the film an emotional gravitas and a cliché-free depiction of a middle-aged affair.",1

225434," As happens occasionally on the putting green, there are brief flashes of tension and drama, but more often it's a long slog to the 18th hole as thoughts drift to that icy martini waiting in the clubhouse.",0
47432, It's laugh-out-loud funny.,1
178657," About as scary as a ride on a minor roller coaster, it unrolls its amplified butcher-block shock effects within the first five minutes.",0
50042, The best part about the third Mummy movie is the Ninja Football Yetis that Brendan Frasier and pals encounter in the mountains of Tibet.,0
29343, The film begins to crackle with life the moment Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth first appear on screen together. Their playful banter offsets the story's gloomy backdrop. ,1
48255, The result is a nearly flavorless 118 minutes punctuated with a few hilarious scenes -- mostly owed to the physical comedy of stage actor Nathan Lane.,0
116755," The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is a movie title that reviews itself.",0
173719," Personal Shopper descends into fragmentation and alienation, and not always rewardingly. It also doesn't help that Stewart's fidgety, mechanical performance indulges some of her worst acting tics.",0

91935," In concept, it's a bad idea; in execution, it's much worse.",0
152359," There is a gaping hole at the heart of this movie where Rabin should be. His death, rather than his life, is the star of this film.",0
196057," The film comes in at 95 minutes, yet it makes scant use of even that time, filling scene after scene with confusing (though often beautiful) kaleidoscopic visuals and not nearly enough plot. ",0
151939," As fresh as the female perspective is, as Skate Kitchen circles and swoops through the Manhattan twilight toward its conclusion, there is a sense of missed potential, that there are better stories to tell that were missed in the rush to drama.",1
165131," We're told this was a Soviet outcrop with constraints on all forms of expression - and low and behold, with the upmost reverence, here's the artistic homage.",0
213213," Production is nicely detailed, from lensing to costume, makeup and set design and make the history lesson one that you will not mind learning.",1
192991, Anyone but the most hopeless addict to linear neatness and plausibility should be tastily beguiled and tantalized by Suspiria's cavalier disregard for making rational sense.,1

207396," Big Hero 6 is still a fun, family-friendly option for a variety of filmgoers, but sadly, its strong opening suggests the finished product could have been better.",1
98527, You're just going to spend the two hours annoyed by all of the stupid decisions Bennett makes.,0
195331," To no one's surprise, the story still works like Gothic gangbusters, thanks in part to reliable back-court support from Judi Dench (as Mrs. Fairfax) and Sally Hawkins (as Jane's venal guardian).",1

22958," Holes is a really wonderful film, full of imagination with an underlying moral message that's neither preachy nor cornball.",1
106282," As all his films have shown, Cuarón is clearly one of the most original filmmakers working today, and Children of Men should solidify his place at the top of those ranks. With a great script, there should be no stopping him.",1
8479, I may not be a doctor but believe me there is no way that Stewart and Pattinson would ever produce a baby this ugly.,0
30931," Thick with potential and irony, and could make for a tremendous film. When Joy embraces that side of itself, it almost gets there. When it doesn't, well, it's just plain bad.",0
249836," Unfortunately, most of the action is overzealously edited, to the point of incomprehensibility, but Neeson's purposefulness and menacing voice provide the framework for a performance. ",0

93175," It's extremely funny, one of the funniest films of 2012, with a particularly winning style - far-fetched, extreme and nonstop.",1

111448, It's an enjoyable peek at the nasty underbelly of society.,1
50987," Directed with unfussy efficiency by Malcolm D. Lee, cousin of Spike Lee, the movie arrives as very much a companion piece to Spike's 'Chi-Raq,' also crafted as a response to the alarming murder rate among young people in Chicago's inner city.",1
32123, The chemistry between the lead cast is evident and the script makes the most of this by giving each actor moments to shine and showcase their skills while they clearly enjoy playing their characters.,1

93977, The film is an ideal introduction on species protection to younger viewers.,1
45790, The main problem is that this Boston-set flick quite unselfconsciously presents itself as if it were a pop-culture first to express ideas about the working-mom balancing act.,0
132096," Not much going on with this one. It was part Scarface, part New Jack City and part Sugarhill. If you've- seen these, you've seen Empire.",0

206194," It's been so long since we've seen the Robert Zemeckis who was a consummate craftsman of pop entertainment, that the flickers we see here of that talent somehow elevate the whole enterprise.",1
185630, A fascinating conversation starter driven by a great performance. Turn it on.,1
235917," This is a talkative picture, allowing time and space for comically preoccupied and quirkily pathetic exchanges between all sorts of strays and losers.",1
24469," Enjoyable enough but no more, please.",1
233681," I Love You Phillip Morris is blunt about illicit personal traits gays share with straights and that define our era. Importantly, the filmmakers don't equate gay with subversive.",1
66210, This parody of '70s slasher flicks like Friday the 13th seems clever for the self-reflexive way it tackles this genre's misogynistic themes and archetypes but it's not nearly as smart as it thinks it is.,0
103461," The fact that this overlong, often preposterous comedy succeeds at all (which it does, only occasionally) proves that the Vaughn/Wilson charm can still work a measure of magic.",0

214207, Moonrise Kingdom is enchanting and warm like fond memories of your first love; but with a self-awareness that sees the hilarity in the eccentrics that abound.,1
136979, Little Monsters works so well at being entertaining and hysterical because Forsythe took such an outrageous idea and just ran with it.,1

66187," While it might lack consistent tension, the atmospheric film has plenty of unsettling moments and builds to an effectively bleak and disturbing finale while subverting genre expectations.",1
149964," Despite expectations, the gifted director Bill Condon is unable to put a peronal signature on this tale, resulting in another disappointing movie to be poorly reviewed but fully embraced by the fans. ",0
150379," A sort of ballet of emotions, executed with weightless grace and poise. ",1

109874," Hard-line traditionalists might clutch their thesis papers and faint, but those interested in radical approaches to art will be amused at how this picture colors in certain details.",1
136038," Four Weddings and a Funeral is one of those rare films that have you smiling from the get-go, and keep you that way -- with a few well-earned poignant interludes (including, of all things, a reading of W.H. Auden) -- right to the end.",1
22059, What makes this film the hands-down worst of Brosnan's 007 outings can be summed up in two words: Denise Richards.,0

106709," Whilst 3D glasses might mask this lapse of originality by putting it all in your face, from a standard visual plane, the creative potential of Verne's novel appears to be inexcusably wasted.",0
31287, Easily engages the viewer in the same fashion as the best of the romance genre.,1
139619," Elevated above the usual fare by an engaging and complex relationship between its two stars, 3:10 To Yuma would be a thoroughly entertaining two hours whatever the genre - the Western setting is almost a bonus. ",1
51870, This is a dazzlingly original silver-screen debut.,1
54355," ...might just be the movie we deserve in this dire election cycle: It's cynical, vulgar, mean-spirited, weirdly familiar and yet often hysterical. ",1

101727, Expect Dano to find work behind a camera again.,1
102745, A movie that wobbles unsteadily between straight-faced action epic and winking self-mockery.,0
241012, I give this movie a lot of credit for actually having a lot of brains and heart... A genuinely enjoyable and funny movie.,1
165612," Witherspoon is never less than a pleasure, and one is thankful for her every close-up.",1
236794," ""Are there any square cops out there?"" says a supporting character in David Ayer's actioner. The answer, of course, is no - and this violent yarn is all the better for it. Next time out, though, he should probably assign himself a less familiar beat.",1

246768," 127 Hours is a powerful movie experience, and you owe it to yourself to see it theatrically for the full unforgettable impact.",1
67979, What starts off as something quite slick slowly devolves into something resembling a typically generic anime film. What a shame.,0
74972, It turns out you don't actually need a hotel to feel like Hotel Transylvania; the monster cruise is a worthy substitute,1

195913, Slight and predictable at its core.,0

103818," There's a brief window... during which Abduction is good enough, which is obviously not the same as ""good"", but any port in a storm.",0
92498," Funny in fragments, Woody Allen's ""To Rome With Love"" is crammed with enough unrelated incidents to fill one of his short-story collections and has the same lack of cohesion. ",0
136593," Amid all the battle hubbub and archery antics, Russell Crowe manages to make us believe this Robin Hood is a man of thought as well as action. ",1
29163," ...too much of the lives of the stars of ""The Fluffer"" and not enough of the examination of the porn business.",0
4946," Matt Damon is fine as salaryman Gardner, as is Julianne Moore, doubling as wife Rose and her twin sister Margaret, but there is too much here that is under-developed and forgettable.",0
329," Easily Payne's most notable work since his 1999 breakthrough ""Election"" and quite possibly the finest work of his entire career. ",1

184323," The story is thin, but it has a kind of easy Irish charm.",1
248548," It's an incredibly watchable and mostly satisfying experience, although it's one that you'll probably forget about four or five hours after you leave the theater.",1
123511," Anyone who watched Siskel & Ebert argue over movies will have a vested interest in ""Life Itself.""",1
25817, A reminder of how human beings can lose their humanity in the face of grief and tragedy but can find it again through helping others rather than turning a blind eye. It's an important work of art.,1

6669, The World of Kanako is a mixed bag of cinematic influences and styles.,0
229714, Ultimately Gulaab Gang is a compelling ninety minute underdog-vs.-the-system action picture that has the misfortune to unfold over the course of two hours and twenty minutes.,0
45685," Donaldson has never found much of a cinematic voice, but his extensive experience serves him well on this finely tuned heist film.",1
660," It's beautifully shot, and though it's a film about outlaws, it often moves slowly, in an almost elegiac manner of affection and sorrow.",1
130953," Sexually charged, frank, and relatable, Take This Waltz is a bittersweet observation of adult romance.",1
158954," The film makes quite a lot out of not very much, and features a strong performance from Tom Hardy, whose versatility continues to impress - and for that it's worth checking out.",1
137231," The loose, seemingly improvisational performances bolster the film's unstudied realism and surface the hope and despair of the characters.",1

111398," A heart-warming, involving experience.",1
32141," If the script is thin and the direction routine, at least many of the performances are engaging, even though there's nothing very subtle in what they're called upon to do. ",0
222736," It's a frisky piece of work, asking challenging questions about monogamy and art, while reveling in the considerable charm of stars Keira Knightley and Dominic West.",1

216125, A committed-to-the-cause Gyllenhaal isn't enough to save Demolition.,0
183763, Lee jumps back and forth between melodramatic speeches and unnecessary monologues so much that he loses all the emotional connection that he could possibly find with his audience.,0
251400," After seeing the film's touching final title cards briefly describing the fates of the characters, I couldn't help wishing for a documentary version.",1
170753," Mother is competent, no more, no less.",0
11360," After what may be one hundred hours, the film does not so much end as it stops, the score's wrapping-up tone an evident substitute for closure or resolution.",0
150191," Oddly, director Steven Soderbergh seems to believe that casting Matt Damon as habitual corporate liar and thief Mark Whitacre constitutes an empathetic protagonist.",1
182061," This is a movie that's content to be pretty good within its genre, with the main distinction of being much bigger than any of its competition.",1
108022," The misadventures of this odd couple manage to deliver some laughs, some obvious moral lessons and, yes, lots of musical segues scored with Rihanna tracks.",1
155485, As desperate as its thousand wannabe brides.,0
215566," Nathanson processes this pungent stew of greed, ambition and self-delusion into pablum so sweet and bland it wouldn't shock a convent-raised idealist.",0
233287," 'Scoop' is funny, charming and keeps you guessing.",1
172305," It would be impossible to detail in this space all the ways Roland Emmerich's latest action/adventure, White House Down, violates the bounds of good (or even moderate) taste. ",0

94423," Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a film that knows about humans all too well, tantalizing our taste buds and warming our hearts.",1
135465," For stories like this to work, one needs suspense and maybe an ounce or two of tension. Lugubrious acting and fancy coats are not enough.",0

175119, Parkland remains a bystander in the already overcrowded field of films about the events of November 1963.,0
129002," Thank goodness that Dinner for Schmucks is not the soulless, mean-spirited movie that its ads make it out to be... Unfortunately, it's still not very funny. Outrageous, perhaps, but it's too full of itself to get emotionally invested in.",0
177258," First Light nimbly condenses similar, more complicated stories for a greater storytelling accomplishment. ",1
140754," Quentin actually made a REAL movie, with believable characters and performances, rather than just repositories for clever dialog.",1
147181," The true circumstances of Cobain's death remain cloudy, but one comes away from the film unnerved by the distance travelled.",1
40186," Propelled forward by tremendous performances, Precious is a pedestrian exploration of social themes and mental, physical and sexual abuse.",1
71901," As has been previously observed, every action movie today ends up as ""Transformers"" and, even when it's cloned creatures fighting, the same is true here (with an antic dash of ""Sharknado"" tossed in for good measure).",0

82571," Ron is back with more crazy adventures in a cheerfully hit-and-miss, guest star-packed romp. ",1
186279, Maybe Barnes' material would be better treated in two 90-minute parts on the BBC. It needs the space to let the audience buy into a version of Tony's history before revealing his unreliability.,0
3049," Every moment where The Last Jedi almost takes a bold risk for the series, it undermines itself to maintain the status quo.",0
116641," A worst-case scenario that preys on parental fears of the monster movie lurking within every teenage rebellion, and it's fed by memories of what we got away with when we were young.",1
36716," Having previously been honest about wrestling's contrivances, Merchant suddenly asks us to believe that a newcomer and a reigning champ would compete in a genuine tussle.",0
194648," In an age of connect-the-dots screenwriting, the sheer verbosity of Friends With Benefits is a form of generosity, and Gluck has the ideal cast to spew it out.",1

72389," Its central flaw of having an unwatchable protagonist is simply too massive to ignore, and sours everything that comes as an extension of it. ",0

142221," Throughout the documentary are gorgeous images of teenagers with goofy, full-of-hope smiles that make your heart ache.",1
7690," Little more than a collection of uninspired plot points and go-nowhere improvs that have been edited together almost at random, this is a film that somehow manages to be even more listless, lifeless and mirthless than the trailers hyping it suggest.",0
101966, Gotti ends up feeling like a kitschy assemblage of other directors' ideas.,0
220980," From the first smoky notes of a theme song sung by Adele, it's clear that ""Skyfall"" will be both classic and of-the-moment.",1
136013, Simply the best film Spielberg has made in decades. Avoids the sentimentality of most--perhaps because of the inclusion of the Coen brothers in the screenwriting team. Their best work in a decade as well for that matter.,1

964," With plots as flimsy as the one presented here, there's a tendency to favor spectacle over character development, and it's no surprise that Raze struggles to balance the two.",0
16185," [Wonder Woman] isn't just a triumph for women, it's a triumph, period. This is grand entertainment with rousing action, sparkling humor, a romantic streak and a titanium-strength debut from Gal Gadot in the title role.",1

200875, De Matteo's systematic examination of this theme is engrossing.,1

85158," I should know better. But it got to me, mostly because of the way the races are shot ? and because of the heartfelt and mostly underplayed performances by the film?s stars.",1
65878," Hayek turns Beatriz into her own breed of wonder woman, Lithgow's Strutt is definitely a super villain of sorts and their head-to-head battle is clearly worth seeing even if, in real life, it has only begun.",1
72744," Ironically, just as the movie points out that the vintage games are most beatable because they follow patterns, Pixels will get a deserved critical beatdown because of the way it does likewise.",0
157274, Not something your average cinemagoer wants to see but important information nonetheless. Let's hope Obama is watching.,1

33110, 360 is a classic example of how you can't always judge a movie by its credits.,0
250365," It's pretty funny, actually, that Stallone gained 40 pounds to play this role, and what the movie needs more than anything else is to eat a salad and do some sit-ups.",0
118114," It's really, really stupid but in the best 'so crazy I can't believe it's a movie' way... I'm especially surprised that Crowe and Haggis made this. They're usually so serious but it seems they just went WTF.",0

203399, Not particularly memorable.,1
93717, Programming the Nation? fails to stick to its stated subject or to coherently fit it into well-trod America-as-propaganda-mill boilerplate. ,0

179273," The stars are excellent, and their offbeat relationship is satisfying, even if the whodunit is not.",1
214144," A yarn that at times feels like a throwback to the mega-actioners of the '80s, when leads could get away with being incorrigible cards as long as they had someone by their side to keep them grounded.",1
215484," If you can embrace the easy-going spectacle of it all and its general respect for the Lone Ranger legacy, you'll probably enjoy it.",1

204277, The film takes pleasure in the simplest moments. And sometimes that's all you can ask for.,1

200637, About as subtle as a fart at a séance,0

137730," It's Complicated may not be all that complicated after all, but at least it's entertaining enough, thanks to Streep and Baldwin.",1
228486," Instead of making the young woman's search feel immediate and universal, such an ascetic treatment locks it away in the past.",0
41249," The film brought me little pleasure, but it revived happy memories of a laidback caper movie also called Slither, starring Peter Boyle and James Caan, made in 1973.",0

5439," Anthony Hopkins really is a prime example of that rare breed of actor whose magnetic presence can lift a film a few notches. With Colin Farrell also on board, the film boasts a strong cast that makes you wonder why the film bypassed cinemas here.",1

186796," Plot problems aside, ""Lola Pater"" does a beautiful job of conveying the full dimensionality of its characters ...",1

20124," This formula is fraught with pitfalls, but the characters and the actors redeem it with a surprising emotional impact.",1
18945," Hopkins has been fitted out prosthetically to resemble Hitchcock and he does a reasonably good job of impersonating him, but it's a foredoomed effort.",0

30283, It cheerfully puts the escape back in escapism.,1
146174," The title is odd, but the film is odder. The film works so long as you're willing to allow that not all stories need a beginning, middle, and end, preferably in that order.",1
251740, The implausible Answer Man offers little clarity but plenty of far-fetched scenarios and credibility-defying coincidences.,0
52457," Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is colourful, multitudinous, often imaginative, but the lack of a hermeneutic world and internal logic lessens the stakes for the viewer to care about.",0
177003," It's not the most complex WWII movie you'll see, but there's no denying the blunt intensity of ""Fury,"" and even if it doesn't sustain, Ayer commits to staring straight into hellish eye of war and bringing audiences along to witness every gruesome detail.",0
191253," The fun lies in allowing yourself to be misled and manipulated, and not trying to impose logic on something that so blatantly disregards it.",1

187688," It's the role of an artist to not just comment on current events, but also to shape that commentary into a dramatic form that'll excite, move and inspire people. Lions for Lambs isn't filmmaking; it's list-making.",0
54955, The film rides on appealing actors tossing non sequiturs back and forth in a series of wish-fulfillment scenarios.,0

127010, It's simply one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen in my life; such a waste of time being in that theater. It's so wholly awful it's almost an acheivement how bad it is.,0
106192, I must also confess my absolute astonishment and delight to discover that it is much better than the treacly nightmare suggested by the ads.,1
134033, The witty dialogue and knowing humour of films like Iron Man and Guardians Of The Galaxy is completely absent here.,0

123902," Vice works best when it's having fun, and only starts to unravel when you get the sense that McKay is trying to appease those that may walk away saying, ""Dude, there's nothing funny about 9/11 and what Haliburton has done to this world."" ",1
49532," Despite its stars, despite its premise, and despite the presence of cute canines, ""Must Love Dogs"" is the most bland romantic comedy of the summer. Possibly of the year.",0

63992," This is one of those movies where good guys don't miss, and bad guys can't shoot to save their lives.",0
16261, Hanks makes the rookie mistake of covering the same points too thoroughly - the film could be 10 to 15 minutes shorter - but you can see why he lets entertaining interviewees ramble a bit.,1
92512," Teller, the quiet half of the iconoclastic magic act Penn and Teller, crafts a captivating documentary portrait of the artist as a tinkerer.",1
209867," Structurally ""Faster"" is as blocky as its star. Fancy camera angles and changes in hue cannot camouflage its stumbling, blunt-force narrative style, in which plot turns are dropped like bricks.",0

148285, The most novel thing about this Israeli torture extravaganza is that writer-directors Aharon Keshales and Navot Papushado play the grisly material for broad comedy.,0
5241," 'San Andreas' is the kind of movie one sees with the biggest bag of popcorn available; it's pure and simple escapism, fun without pretensions. Watch it in 3D, and watch it with little expectations, and you'll have a good time. [Full review in Spanish]",1
51021," It is, quite simply, a good story told in an entertaining, imaginative and heartfelt way. Now come on, DreamWorks; was that really so difficult?",1

72615," As an unintentional send-up of the predictability and wretchedness of modern action-comedies, Chill Factor is hilarious. Sadly, however, no one involved seems to realize the silliness and transgressive stupidity of its sub-direct-to-video-thriller script.",0
127724, A provocative period drama that's not only captivating but eye opening with a tragically accurate yet profound statement about police criminality and social injustice.,1
155866," Predictable, tired, formulaic, it makes up for its lack of originality with a bigger budget, louder jokes, louder costumes, and louder music.",0

26546, A ridiculously plotted and distressingly violent action movie that never makes the case for its own existence.,0
133509," Café Society may enchant the viewer with its lush visuals and close-ups of Stewart's smouldering expressions, and it may prove sufficiently entertaining.",1

126114," Alicia Vikander is not only drop-dead gorgeous, she is as good an actress as I've ever seen, worth the price of admission alone. Almost hopelessly romantic, there was not one slow moment in this film. On a scale of 10, I'd like to give this an 11.",1
231468," Somewhere, Irene Cara weeps.",0

47407, How do you manage to make [this] premise - which I was happily on board with until the first 10 minutes dragged by - as boring as this is?,0
45954," As a died-in-the-wool Muppets fan, this overripe nostalgia trip only almost captures that Henson magic. There are moments of exhuberance, but they're scattered and isolated.",0
141928," It explores Bergman's usual concerns over marriage, sex and despair, but is not up to the director's better works.",1
187570, The film's Capraesque centerpiece is built from a series of fuzzily developed narrative threads and flip pieces of ominous detail.,0

85323," Jeffs makes a good fist of the direction and Blunt proves that she can do comedy, but it's Adams's comforting, charismatic central turn which really gives the film its lift.",1
101079, This mediocre film that is heavy on computer-generated imagery adds up to little more than the Yawn-icles of Narnia.,0

78778," Michael Cane is precise, convincing and the best part of this film. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
26217," Jolie gets many opportunities to cry and a few to overact furiously, but even her fury gets lost in an interminable ending and period detail that doesn't just envelop the film but suffocates it.",0
206241," Ida is a gorgeous and humble tale of stiff upper lips and scars that refuse to heal, where every frame is imbued with melancholic beauty and a quiet grace.",1
187748," Though hardly a film for all sensibilities, Bad Lieutenant has the courage of its own convictions, and follows them to the bitter end.",1
207059," Hero is a beautifully crafted movie, but unfortunately it's also carelessly revisionist.",1
52407," It may cover some ground the director covered in Goodfellas or Casino, but nothing in those pictures can match up to the mania on display here.",1

36457," If ""Leaving"" is a story of a broken marriage, what, exactly, went wrong?",0
169203," John Carroll Lynch's lovely Lucky has exactly as much story as it needs, and it doesn't need much considering that it's the final leading role for Harry Dean Stanton, who recently passed away at 91.",1
169718," In 39 years, I have never written these words in a movie review, but here they are: You owe it to yourself to see this film. If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you should explain to them why you decided not to.",1
178227," The film tries to sound ponderous in matters of death and fate, but achieves only the level of art-house pretension.",0
99131, Here is perhaps a good litmus test to determine whether or not Johnny English is for you: do you think Rowan Atkinson can be funny just by showing up?,1
207721, Kevin Costner's haircut is the worst in movie history and that's criminal. Guilty pleasure for those liking the genre. ,1
211457," A black-and-white salute to the French New Wave (the score is borrowed from Georges Delerue, composer of many a Truffaut and Godard film) that manages to be very much of this moment ...",1
115961, The chemistry between Kunis and her co-star Justin Timberlake is electric.,1
231280," ""The Danish Girl"" is beautifully shot and tastefully made and acted, but only Vikander seems willing to take chances. Happily, she does.",1
46412," If this movie achieves anything, it makes you realize how dull parties really are.",0
7677, Too slight to add up to much,0

228987, A beautiful and darkly lyrical film,1
231524," Welcome To Marwen turns everything progressive into something problematic, not doing right by any of its heroes, especially its diverse female characters.",0
30594," Add in a few dirty jokes, including one about a woman asking a gent to . . . (well, that one was needed to avoid a PG rating), plus pertinent news clips from each era, and you have The Cosby Show meets Forrest Gump meets Do the Right Thing.",1
46480, Cotton candy on the eyes...audiences will find plenty of superficial delights.,1
228516," The M. Knight brilliance is there in quick jolts of suspense and terror, but those moments are the exception in this otherwise flat little thriller.",0
190405," Unlike its more artful antecedent, Day of the Soldado features an array of striking dead ends, glaring red herrings, unceremonious deaths and absent figureheads. ",0
233684," He's an Irishman, she's a seal. It'll never work.",1
135458," As French crime thrillers go, this is about as good as it gets. It's also an important film historically, and to top it off, the jazz score, by Miles Davis, is famous in its own right.",1
36115," If you squint hard enough and hop on one foot, it's actually an entertaining B-movie, delivering some agreeably frantic moments in a European setting.",1
231160," Francis Veber, the writer and director of The Valet is a master of French comedy...To cut to the chase, The Valet est un comédie plaisant et léger, mais il n'est pas mémorable du tout.",1

59629," A slam-bang, action-packed chase movie that puts the audience smack-dab in the middle of pre-Columbian America. If you can stand the gore and violence, ""Apocalypto"" is a don't-miss experience.",1
3414, Horror-movie protagonists should know better than to make wishes on mysterious ancient artifacts.,0
151607," If I wrote this review the way Pizzo wrote the script, it would be something like this: I saw a movie. It was about football. It was sad. ",0
155108," A forthright and compelling film but Angelina Jolie has become so notable, I could never forget she was playing a role.",1
22587," Speed Racer offers a crazy, turbo-charged mix of cartoon kitsch, gamer action, and a wild new way to think of -- and look at -- movies.",1
230812," The film traces Cernan's career trajectory, going back to his days in San Diego as a hot-shot naval aviator, blending terrific archival footage with contemporary perspectives to quietly poetic effect.",1
162510," Kangana Ranaut walks away with the entire film, playing both Tanu and Kusum with panache, in what is probably the defining female performance of 2015 (in a year already filled with many). Yet, even she cannot salvage this film in the end.",0

99719, It's so gripping you won't mind the subtitles.,1
202019," Four Brothers is several movies in one slick, stressed vehicle, its hard-grinding gears meshing with infectious gusto and rough-and-tumble vigor.",1

208167," So simple, yet so effective.",1
16194," A tough, uncompromising picture, with a climax that really goes to work on you.",1
224271," The movie plays best as a joke on Disney. The critique of the corporation and its theme parks, however, is lame and not at all new",1
88822, A gift to Queen fans. Rami Malek is astonishing as Freddie Mercury. Live Aid ending is enormous high.,1

112650," A total mess but not without its genuinely funny moments, this Relativity release is one to store away in the how-did-this-ever-happen vault.",0
55446," The new disco era film 54 is Fame on drugs, a low-grade Saturday Night Fever.",0
168208," They all plod along while sometimes dazzling, sometimes boring special effects whiz by and Ford's climactic confrontation with Hauer approaches. Instead of tension building, though, things are grinding to a halt, including Hauer's gears.",0
56187," For the second half of the film, it's all chase and chase and chase some more, with little audience involvement in how it turns out.",0
60082, Homosexual road movie that espouses the family values of a Disney feature and the pop art sensibilities of a Warhol piece - with a dose of Shakespeare added for good measure.,1

233201," Plays like Red Dragon reimagined by filmmakers who think they're too smart or too sophisticated or too high-minded to give themselves over to the sordid, sleazy and flat-out nasty.",0
171957," The setting acts as a bland backdrop without substance or thought. Worst of all, the dialogue feels horribly contrived, even lazy. A misguided misfire.",0
101882," Looks like Sandler and company wanted an excuse to hang out, so they lazily filmed this movie, while probably having a great time off screen. ",0
99268," Excellent sight gags, clever dialogue, and improbable waistline.",1

139453," Welcome back, Jack.",1

246142," Coco is as indebted to Ratatouille as it is to Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away, but the combination of sensibilities and the colorful, semi-spooky milieu of the afterlife realm where most of the film is set is not at all unwelcome.",1

229777," Maybe Life of Pi isn't entirely unfilmable, but Lee wasn't quite able to conquer it.",0
149358," ...a yawner plot set-up that leads to lots of wannabe off-colour gags, a small army of pursuing villains and an expected final act in which Jason's icky-sticky niceness might perhaps stop McCarthy from being a shrieking psychopath.",0
179948," Walter Hill's direction's real cool, and the photography is beautiful. The film is also pretty funny. The leads are great.",1
19230, The film lacks any of the cinematic sophistication of Gilroy's last two films.,0

154360, Unmitigated nonsense to anyone but diehard fans.,0
249654, Zoom is so concerned with managing its complicated narrative that none of the quirky array of characters ever feels genuine.,0
92713," It's an absolute joy to see Lloyd Christmas again, and Carrey seems impossibly revitalized.",1
223285," Stillman's script snarls with wit and snarky commentary on social organizations. He certainly has a unique style, and it makes me want to seek out his earlier films. Unfortunately, I felt like the film kind of petered out in the last act.",0
23256," A cute, spunky found-footage thriller undone by a lumpy plot and a weak ending, ""Operation Avalanche"" revisits the urban legend that the moon landing was faked, with some fresh twists.",0

94411," Can't possibly compare to the film it's inspired by, but if you've not seen the 1982 version, you should find it reasonably harmless, albeit with an increasingly daft climax.",0
112605, All the animals in the new Tarzan film are computer-generated which makes this new would be blockbuster feel not unlike a cartoon.,0
149573," The first part of the last part is dark, dismal, and frankly, disappointing.",0
24126," Undeniably talented and way underused, Pearce brings just the right balance of bewilderment, anger and melancholic acceptance to a role that must almost single-handedly carry the entire movie.",1

207806, Contrasts European greed and decadence with the fallout visited upon Africa due to the relentless rape of its natural resources in the name of profit.,1
3066," 80 some odd minutes of bland, boring, tedious nonsense. Utterly inept and squandering potential at every opportunity, the only 'interesting' thing the film has going for it is an ending that is totally bizarro, terribly conceived and bafflingly stupid. ",0
106250," Calendar Girls may be boomer-baiting formula, but this ingratiating, big-hearted holiday treat is as British as plum pudding -- and the closest thing on the market to the famous Ealing comedies.",1

247622, Intercutting the story's action with eclectic performance clips from YouTube delivers the film's most intriguing point. You're going to find much more raw talent online than anywhere else in this movie.,0

45611, Aiming for cheap laughs and situational humor that doesn't appeal to the emotional side of its adult audience. ,0
108313," There's not quite enough muscle to really sink your teeth into, but fans of the Blade-type vampire movies should be pleased.",0
191631," There are a handful of legitimately funny jokes, even though -- though it frightens me to say so -- I don't get as excited as I got when I was fifteen.",1
202523," Other than the restrained romantic flashbacks, there's nothing in this movie that hasn't been done better before.",1

208248," It might not be his best filmmaking, but ""Fahrenheit 11/9"" is fraught with a critical mindset that syncs with the zeitgeist. It's a messy movie for messy times.",1
40294," Balancing its darker moments with humor and warmth, the picture has a broad enough appeal to - finally, movie gods? - get Winstead onto the first-choice lists of top-tier filmmakers.",1
48992," After two hours in Walker's slack-jawed company, you feel like you've just gone through the Antarctic winter yourself.",0
86185, The mixing of vague historical anecdote and pure Hollywood fantasy don't quite mix.,0
41802," Araki lets his absurdist imagination run wild, and ""Kaboom"" takes the time-honored gambit of gradually revealing that nothing is as it seems to delightfully cockamamie extremes.",1
112423," A bold, unsettling transposition of Leskov's grim take on a Shakespearean motif-a promising debut for its director and a stunning breakthrough for its star.",1
91448," Filmed with a master's eye, ""Hereafter"" continues the streak of outstanding films directed by Clint Eastwood. ",1
63401, A happy meal with a glum dessert,0
230253," If this were twenty years ago, Escape Plan would be pretty awesome. Oh wait, no it wouldn't.",0
167970," What undoes the film is its rather rancid parent-child sentimentality (a Shyamalan staple, admittedly) and a charisma-free performance from the younger Smith that suggests the apple has fallen very far from the tree, indeed.",0
187980, A riveting revenge thriller written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier and built around a singular performance by Macon Blair.,1
209225," It's hard not to get sucked in--if one can get past the sometimes hokey, melodramatic teenage dialogue.",1
58129," Cronenberg turns a difficult, sometimes frustrating book into a difficult, sometimes frustrating movie, though one with many of the same rewards as its source material ...",0
125311," If you've become a little cynical about going to movies due to inflated ticket prices, Michael Bay films and chatty audiences, Hugo may restore your faith in the wonder of cinema.",1
108167," The film's patient, naturalistic depiction of teen life - created over eight months of character workshopping with the young cast - simply doesn't allow for ideological grandstanding. ",1
142518, Chereau wrings the anger and disappointment and creates a rather extraordinary missive about disconnection in a world where it's easy to renege on vows and promises.,1
4272," Feels like a movie that has a lot more to say, but can't figure out how to convey its message despite a fantastic effort from its leading man.",0
50672," At this point in his career, writer/director/producer Niccol seems to be amusing himself -- indeed he's admitted as much in terms of the winks and nods to Gattaca that he's peppered the film with. ",1
173445," Yes, we needed one more spin on Dickens' most famous tale (although Magoo's version still rocks...).",1
250630," Good performances that will make you cry, go ahead, it's healthy once in a while. [Full review in Spanish]",1
35456," It takes approximately 15 seconds for Accepted to begin showcasing Mac products, a somewhat foregone conclusion given star Justin Long's stint as the face of Apple computers' recent ad campaign.",0
67447, The searching loss-of-faith drama First Reformed is the happy result of Paul Schrader's entering the what-the-hell-let's-go-for-it stage of his long and bravely self-lacerating career.,1
102477," The flaw in Glass's surface is, ironically, its opacity. Instead of interrogating the structure of superhero narratives, Shyamalan uses it as a crutch, explicitly drawing attention to it whenever his story begins to topple. ",0
62509," I loved the film as a rockumentary, but the private life of Morrison is less interesting.",1
211106," Sweet, sentimental, and vibrant, Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" rightfully points out that yesterday's frolicking bar might be today's laundry mat ... but we can always visit the good times in our memories.",1
247748, It's an invaluable document about closeted Hollywood history and a delightful tribute to a talented man who lived to tell his tale of survival.,1
150460, Harsh punishments are dished out in a way that jolts the material away from coming-of-age cliché.,1
147324, This is not David O. Russell's finest work. It's no American Hustle or The Fighter. But it's still a solid effort worth seeing.,1
214617," Ken Loach's latest Cannes Fest entry is a light, amiable Scottish fable (with dark tones to be sure) about how the discovery of whisky can change one's life.",1
22018," ""Backcountry"" inevitably brings on the bloody, but it finds atmospheric ways to depict how the bucolic hush of a nature getaway can morph into a survival nightmare for the unprepared.",1
78538," It delivers an emotional punch, in what its director has called a story about the sin of indifference.",1
107625," The concept is intriguing but the emotional payoff is negligible, the surprise ending is feeble and the whole enterprise resembles a recycling bin. ",0
17308," It's hard to quibble with Sightseers, and its satirical, observational eye is spot on, mining to laser-like effect hitherto underdocumented subjects in British comedy cinema.",1
196130," Eerily inhabiting the netherworld where a young girl's wildest dreams become her cruelest nightmares, Coraline is a dark delight.",1
20858, For a while you go along for the ride. But as the film progresses it becomes increasingly unwieldy.,0
212275," Flat-out wonderful - an irresistable coming-of-age comedy that's smart, funny and wise.",1
158737," A god-awful chick flick about black women bonding in a sugary, never-never South. It should be renamed How to Make an American Wilt (and any other viewer).",0
171034," Once seen, it's impossible to shake from the mind.",1
74029, I'd see this movie again just for Kate McKinnon's unhinged grin and her ga-ga delivery.,1
205965, Hanging out with Julia Roberts being all glowy and charming -- even when she's somewhat sad about whatever it is she's sad about -- is still kind of pleasurable.,0
251960, This is a film that could well earn a cult following. There is little visual flash to the story but it is an accomplished technical mystery. ,1
97097," True Sandler fans will want to know only where Zohan stands on the A.S. scale, with Happy Gilmore at the top and Little Nicky at the bottom. I'd put it closer to the latter than the former.",0
31231," By the time the end credits roll around, you realize nothing's actually been risked. It's the gambling equivalent of Go Fish.",0
245203," It's a shame that within such beauty lies a pretty gloomy story, one that foolishly trusts the audience will get behind the whole stealing-a-baby concept. I didn't, and I got very bored.",0
174381," The script isn't just ""dumbed down,"" it's lobotomized. Godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone.",0
78628," A flat, boring, lifeless movie pro-environmental groups ought to protest as a waste of natural resources. Perhaps 20th Century Fox could give some free popcorn to people who buy tickets to their next movie.",0
157666," After dispensing with the sluggish setup of the film's first act, Berg shifts into high gear, powerfully evoking the feelings of dread and white-knuckle excitement that much of America no doubt felt as the manhunt progressed.",1
69167," With all the finesse of a bullhorn that sprays noise and blood, ""All Cheerleaders Die"" shows just how difficult it is to pump life into the shopworn teen horror-comedy genre.",0
23208," Funny, well-acted, but mostly full of heart, this film is the ultimate proof that there's still much to see from J.K. Rowling's universe of wizards and witches. [Full review in Spanish]",1
172353, ...a missed opportunity of distressing proportions...,0
202746," Whatever else happens in ""Much Ado,"" we need to believe there's something between Beatrice and Benedick and, here, that something feels like nothing.",0
131656," If only Coixet and Kernochan would flirt with danger a little more in their filmmaking, we could have had a more memorable film on our hands.",0
235927, Is there not something just plain wrong with a movie about cheating on exams that's less fun than taking one?,0
129876," For a movie that tries so hard to be disturbing, Nightcrawler is actually quite comforting. It takes a societal sickness and blames it on a boogeyman. ",0
18382, Wide-eyed innocence and intrigue are admirably balanced and the story flows very well.,1
199581," A perfect storm of aggressively repulsive choices, it's a queasy bad trip worth avoiding at all costs.",0
73449," The director and star of ""Amélie"" (Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Audrey Tautou) reunite for this grimmer, grimier, but no less magnificent moviegoing experience.",1
23712," Witherspoon gives an unvarnished, all-in performance, free of vanity and entirely devoted to telling Strayed's grueling, triumphant story.",1
135967, The jokes are so sketchy and silly it quickly passes the point of wretched excess.,0
217669," ...an insane document, a slice of life that we probably should never have seen. But now that we have seen it, it's too late to deny its crippling poignancy...",1
199501," When it's done you're a little groggy and resent yourself a bit. But its absurdly slick, wholly surface-level appeal is hard to deny.",1
33614, This crass comedy smells like kitty litter.,0
119232," As much about dealing with the pain of parting as an artistic memoir, this is a bittersweet delight.",1
39610, A gore-filled guilty pleasure...,1
151727, The film is a demanding but praiseworthy experience. ,1
37451, Increasingly preposterous and uninvolving.,0
221846, The surprise will come when they learn that this sequel re-enforces a very important virtue: Be careful what you wish for. ,0
200977," 'Biutiful' is not one of the year's five best films, but Javier Bardem's performance may very well be. ",1
169679, Suburbicon might be the biggest embarrassment to pious Hollywood liberalism since Crash won best picture in 2006.,0
186204," Snatch is hard to figure out, but even harder not to laugh at.",1
158355," The film has its faults...but these are outweighed by its rare and authentic portrayal of Roma in cinema, as well as the hopeful message it carries for those members of the LGBT community who face similar obstacles.",1
120144," With no other performance coming close to being as layered as Carell's, the rest... is played for laughs to such an extent that it never reaches Pixar-plotted heights.",1
50365," There's genuine outrage behind Lee's angry blast of hip-hop agitprop, and his fury has good cause... Unfortunately, his film is also a gaudy mess.",0
133193, Blade Runner 2049 is an upgrade in most departments and is an utter joy to watch.,1
230273," It's 2/3's of a decent movie. The reworked ending kills it's momentum and ends it on a very sour, underwhelming note. ",0
224934, The Cinema Travellers acts as both paean and elegy for this declining but inherently charming mode of exhibition.,1
207048," While The Dictator may appear different than Borat and Brüno, it is very much the same idea as both films, packed with the same jokes and new ones that are more disturbing than they are hilarious.",1
155113," The jokes are few. And the only real reason you'll laugh is that, by the time they appear on screen, you've been waiting so long for the opportunity, you'll laugh at anything.",0
72458, More with these sequels is always less. The proportions haven't been right since 2002.,0
250752," There's little if anything here to keep us emotionally invested, and so the pile-it-on mutinies and sword fights and perilous dives off vertiginous cliffs exist just to wow us.",0
247532," There is much to admire in this film... But it's as if the whole thing has been emotionally cauterised. It holds you at arm's length. As such, I found it peculiarly unsatisfying. If it had been a restaurant meal, I'd have come home and had a sandwich.",0
6660," De Jesus' outbursts are the only excitement in 'Illegal,' since the performances of most of the rest of the cast are barely amateurish and Reyes' story is not so much old-school as it is old-hat.",0
241897," In the wake of the Trayvon Martin verdict, this compassionate film reclaims the humanity of victims transformed into political symbols and provides context for those who think the media and not Zimmerman's bullet 'injected race' into the Martin killing.",1
202022, The movie is the latest multiplex filler to co-opt a classic tale only to drown it in computer-generated murk. Even the title has the ring of something created by committee.,0
156272," An impressive time capsule, driven by a memorable performance by David Strathairn",1
131056," Actors Josh Duvendeck, Kyle S. More, Matt Cook and Matt Shively get some OK slapstick energy going with this, but advocates for those with learning disabilities would not be wrong if they have complaints.",0
103628," The production seems genuinely fearful of turning this effort into anything more than a dewy tale of deliverance, with a side portion of hunks. ",0
233833," a disjointed mess, part art-house melodrama, part Hollywood action flick.",0
108717," Glossy and engrossing, Human Capital unfolds like a variation on one of those films that spend two hours showing how a handful of seemingly unrelated characters are connected.",1
34289, Here's the mystery for me. How did questions that started out so vast and existential swirl down into something so small and loopy and pathetic?,0
66840, Anchored by two strong performances from Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara.,1
86828," Cruise buoys the film's flop-sweat intensity. He seems to understand his character's desperate, ingratiating whirligig restlessness from the inside. This is that rare time that one of his slick charmers lets you see behind the curtain.",1
150782, This doesn't seem like a movie of passion or even significant intrigue for its subject. The movie feels like a work of obligation.,0
19004," A joyful film, an affirmation of inner wisdom, and an acknowledgment of the enlightened telos Pai so gently manifests.",1
153567," There are plenty of moments in a teenage girl's life where the trivial becomes momentous, and they are presented here with a poignant and compassionate vibrancy.",1
166330," ""The Snowman"" is like if aliens studied humanity and tried to make their own movie in an attempt to communicate with us.",0
185777," This is a baggy, pointless, tiresome film, which is also messy, puerile, cack-handedly gruesome and plain unfunny.",0
78160," Disappointing dance drama that suffers from a badly scripted plot, dull performances and poorly choreographed dance routines.",0
45473," There's simply no cure for the fundamental laziness behind ""Paul,"" which amounts to a recycling program for tired gags about nerds, gays, nervous-nelly Brits, dumbass Yanks and little green men.",0
120485, There's just something missing in translation from that most powerful book.,0
19487," The best way to tell when things are getting bleak is to check Dakota Fanning's face. When she starts to look like a poached egg, that's when you better hide.",0
140479," The film is packed with inventive songs, the best of which comes in the end credits.",1
103958," Immigration remains a politically hot topic, one that cries out for nuanced, reasoned examination in a thoughtful film. ""Desierto"" isn't it.",0
187420," Fittingly, for a film that Miyazaki says will be his last, it's also something of a self-portrait in its depiction of a nearsighted, work-driven dreamer whose imagination soars above the rest.",1
234929," Interstellar may be a failure on a story level, but Nolan's visual virtuosity is still enough to take your breath away and root you to your chair.",1
73894," Thanks to a clever script, tight direction, a first-rate cast and the dynamite combination of Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone, Blast from the Past blows away the recent crop of romantic comedies.",1
244170," The under-5 set may find it funny, though I suspect their parents will be checking their watches a lot, as I did.",0
79216," Its structure of leaden philosophical conversation followed by butt-kicking, repeated repeatedly, is formulaic, but it is certainly awe-inspiringly cool when it wants to be.",1
118053," A Cormac McCarthy horror-mystery with all its ingenuity and without Hollywood compromise. Happily for literature, the movie retains the fright and power of the novel with its shock ending.",1
210206, Like a laboratory experiment on how often a movie can spin from bad to good and back again.,0
134981, This limp biopic may inspire you to reach for the air sickness bag.,0
137759," Escape from Tomorrow is a genuinely surprising, extremely uneven, downright experimental little movie that's bound to be buzzy in film and intellectual property circles because of how it was made as much as what it's about.",1
61299, Young Ms. Harris is probably the movie's most powerful element. ,1
89188," The kids are sensitively drawn, if a little pick-and-mix in terms of their issues and ethnicities, and the whole movie breathes with kindness and intelligence.",1
91208," Much mayhem, brawling, dubious CGI, close encounters of the sexual kind and mystical gibberish ensue. Little of it makes sense. Less of it is exciting.",0

151540, I found myself becoming bored and tuning the film out.,0
116159," Wiseman loves a chase - the film is littered with them - but forgets the rest. The author Philip K Dick would not be impressed, although Farrell emerges unscathed.",0

240017, IIt's important and it's gripping.,1
167252, It's all efficiently done and gory but director Samuel Bayer adds so little to the old familiar scare story that you wonder why they didn't just save a bob or two and reissue the Robert Englund original.,0
234716, Cohen's spare but spectacularly visualized film follows a pair of middle-aged strangers who meet in a Viennese art museum and proceed to walk and talk.,1

103319," It's kind of the love child of Michael Haneke and Eli Roth, meaning that it's basically arty torture-porn, but made on tranquilizers. ",0
187010," Instead of a regular kids film, this one becomes tirying, squematic and really predictable. [Full review in Spanish]",0
101904," It has a breathless, often frantic storyline that doesn't add up to much. But the beautifully rendered undersea locations and a rip-roaring nail-biter of an ending make up for the slack.",1
218742," Beasts Of No Nation is a masterful film; assured, confident, artful.",1
5326," This is a movie as its own death wish. To call it cheap, lazy, and perfunctory grants it a dignity that implies there was another path it could have taken.",0
194459," Some may say it overreaches, but give me that over a simple safety net any day.",1
35628," A film so uncertain about its tone and sensibilities that it just doesn't work. If Wan and screenwriter Ian Jeffers had just embraced the ridiculous retribution-based violence, it might have been more entertaining, albeit odious.",0

1059, A punk looks at 40 tale that plays like a reality TV pilot that's a little too real (boring) for its own good. ,0

20052, The Black Dahlia isn't just bad. It's impressively bad. I didn't think they could make a movie this bad.,0
194586, Lewis Milestone's groundbreaking war film is up with La Grande Illusion as one of the finest humanitarian antiwar movies ever made.,1
75850," The lackluster performances add to the tedium of a story that, frankly, just isn't that interesting, despite its importance in Ginsburg illustrious career and that of U.S. jurisprudence.",0
235452, The usual over-familiar mélange of forensic evidence and titillating torture porn that reminds me why I don't watch network television procedurals. ,0

114758, May not be the final drop in the X-Men cash bucket but its clear that whatever creative well fans wished upon for their beloved series has been officially dried up.,0
1068," The less I thought about Sherlock Holmes, the more I liked Sherlock Holmes.",1
185114," As far as this summer's movie doomsday prophecies go, Herzog's feels somehow strangely brighter and more upbeat than even Wall-E.",1

77917," It is the 21st century nightmare, played out with a boy's toys and a boy's idiotic sensibility. ",0
204551," Basically a frothy tabloid take on presidential history. And for my money, that's a good thing in a season filled with puffed-up prestige pictures.",1
21731," An ironic sort of vanity piece in that it tries to be such an anti-vanity piece -- bluntly intimate, rather than a peek behind the curtain -- but it feels honest all the way.",1
247778, Some viewers have found this film adorable but its quirky cuteness was lost on me.,0
30095, ...it gives a universiality that rarely works in films centered on a specific historical fact. [Full Review in Spanish] ,1
53323," Richanbach keeps ""Ibiza"" flowing along as fast as possible, creating an appealing screen party with game actresses and a throbbing EDM soundtrack, also providing a steady run of laughs to support all the goofiness. ",1
196205," Finally, there's something a little sketchy about the movie, a little unfinished and scattergun. The figure of Jesse recedes in importance, and it's Celeste whose delusions we focus on. ",0
121468," Ultimately, there is something distasteful about this approach ― especially as the stylistic bravura seems calculated to leave minimal room for thought. ",0
9254," Cinematographer Marco Pontecorvo's sun-drenched palette would be a perfectly sound reason to see this film, but happily it's not the only one.",1
97926," The movie is technically brilliant, it's beautifully acted and it's an order of magnitude more amusing than anything the downbeat Inarritu (""21 Grams,"" ""Babel"") has made to date.",1
29423," Unsuccessfully walks the line between intellectual and physical comedy, but does have many genuinely funny moments",0

72993," Based on a true incident during Vietnam War, the film testifies to our hopes that there are a few ethical souls who believe the weak must be protected.",1
241177, Not helped by an unnervingly dumb screenplay and a performance from Tatum that makes wood seem too pliable a substance with which to describe it.,0
210475," ""Rango'' is a highly watchable but somewhat frustrating mix of sloppy plotting, rascally attitude, and Big Action.",1
49221, Extremely tense and elegantly shot ...,1
79512," Knightley and West head a pitch-perfect cast, and Westmoreland (aided by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens and designer Michael Carlin) flawlessly recreates Belle Époque France.",1
227692," The melodrama among the main characters is more soap opera than grand opera, even with a quartet of actors as fine as this.",0
96268," The film veers a bit wildly between silly playfulness and extreme rudeness, but it keeps us hooked by maintaining believable characters.",1
149523," Juliet, Naked tries hard but the movie flounders between the streams of lame comedy and the springs of affection.",0

41558, Pap in service of wistfulness about a time period now thoroughly mocked to death.,0
173847," I can't speak for the kids, but I would rate Spike Jonze & Dave Eggers's adaptation of Maurice Sendak's 40-page children's picture book up there with Up and WallE as topping the recent renaissance in children's movies.",1
188997," Ultimately, The Mummy isn't absolutely terrible... there's a lot of potential here that's been squandered by including Cruise and Crowe.",0
165551, Teaching important history to younger generations via popular culture is always a worthy cause. It's just that soaking this sobering story in a soppy romance does little to advance that cause.,0
44272, We already know how this film turns out and no one at Lucasfilm has the wit to make the journey interesting.,0

68336, A cleverly conceived little horror-thriller.,1
120671," ... Jeff Grace's Folk Hero & Funny Guy doesn't feel like a warmed-over Apatow production, in part because it has the courage to let the ""funny guy"" half of its duo be kind of a mediocrity in his field.",1
34794," A killer film and very satisfying, Wolf Creek 2 is also, hopefully, a sign of a healthy film industry, one buoyant enough to produce crowd-pleasing sequels from crowd-pleasing originals. No shame in that. ",1
205431," No other director I can think of has come as close as Bresson to molding his players into what are, in effect, variations on a continuing personality, much the way a painter might.",1
220193," The Dardennes smoothly shift one gear up in the film's coda, offering a sting of humility before a flash of quiet grace. Then we're left watching after one boy on his bike, stubbornly moving, moving, moving, a force to be reckoned with and respected.",1
214678," Creators Joel and Ethan Coen clearly love this distinct era in Hollywood history. What Hail, Caesar! fails to do is say anything meaningful about it.",0
89679," An unashamed, ""Independence Day at sea"" slugfest that somehow manages to just about keep its head above water, mostly due to a comedic sense of self-awareness. ",1

64935," Even though Vaughn knows how to build a pretty good performance out of little more than exasperated eye-rolling, he's just coasting here, and his scenes with Giamatti have no weight and no energy.",0
53465," A fascinating documentary that leverages Herzog's unique perspective on movies, art, mankind, and the natural world.",1
31439," [It] has drama, comedy, romance and class politics. It also introduces an element of ethnic prejudice to the mix.",1
235053," A giddy, hyperkinetic take on a very, very British style of action ...The wit may be as dry as 007's martini, but the sensibilities are completely Tarantino.",1
155134," The food looks great, but the romance is undercooked, and God remains strictly a bit player.",0
69273," The nagging notion that none of this is funny and much of it is sad dawns early, and that's confirmed when the movie pauses in its manic reprising for sappy sentimentalizing.",0
56419," Unravels from about the twenty minute mark on and makes no attempt to recover. Rather, it becomes more cliché and ham fisted as it rolls along.",0
64653," A preening, superficial film that expects you to appreciate its smart concept without noticing the stupid execution.",0

137692," The movie's 135 minutes [feels] long. But the length is a product of [director] Temple's desire to cram in as much as he can. Despite the festival's drawbacks, it's obvious Temple loves everything about it. Even Coldplay.",1

217417, It overflows with middle-aged angst over lost youth. And laments the generic nature of our corporate-driven culture.,1

91599, [City of Ghosts] reveals accurate information as the first weapon of resistance.,1
69971, The even larger issue is familiarity. We already know too much and paradoxically too little about the JFK assassination. A TV movie needed to tell us something we don't know. No dice here.,0

133348, It's a great deal of effort by a lot of talented people that results in two-plus hours of tepid clockwork blandness.,0
202833, This is probably the most pure science fiction work that author Michael Crichton have ever done.,1

67060," I feel bad marking this rotten because the subject is so important, but the execution is just not there.",0
48223, Develops the feel-good plot in true newspaper style: a few heart tugs followed by a punch in the face.,1
40366," The Last Hangover, much like Python's Life of Brian ... will not be suitable for those who are offended by anything that pokes fun at religion. For the rest of us, though, this film is an irreverent, warped, good time.",1
156524," its treatment of race resides comfortably at the sitcom level, where it's safe to laugh about difference and then console ourselves with eventual inclusiveness",0
157869," Its archetypal influence on later films like Goodfellas and the Al Pacino Scarface is striking, even if we can never again experience how new and bold it was back in its day....",1
196765," Recalling the captivating essence of Niki Caro's Whale Rider (2002) in its telling of a life with fate and faith in its corner, this Australian/Laotian/Thai co-production could find similar breakout success once (inevitably warm) word of mouth spreads.",1
128204," Hopkins is typically commanding as the retired caped crusader (who hangs out in a cave like that other one), and Banderas is suave and dashing as his protégé.",0

114217, License to kill? Bond has a license to offer barely adequate entertainment.,0
131340," Don't be fooled by the title, this isn't a bouncy 70s-style comedy. Tonally it's a mixed bag, and the last act doesn't work. I came out as much bemused as deflated. The performances keep it watchable, along with a big set-piece action scene.",0

136308, The film is as slick as any Hollywood thriller ... that dilute the impact of what might have been an indelible cautionary tale.,0
56751," Though overly melodramatic at times and absent the full details of the toll CTE really takes, Concussion is at its best when operating as an underdog story.",1
50205, Katja's story is heartbreaking and intimate. Akin pulls no punches as you watch it spiral toward the dramatic climax.,1
62825," It all feels unbelievably relevant in the year 2017. The hate and fear lives on, and continues to burn bright.",1
128927, Not so thrilled about the way every female seemed like a caricature-all of them needing a man to validate them in some way; all of them seeming incomplete until McBurney. ,0
193925," When it works -- and it doesn't half the time -- it's as if Monty Python were back, putting its merrily imbecilic stamp on the dark world of terrorism.",1
95721," Lee paints intimate characters who are about more than the game. Themes of integrity, honesty, loyalty and familial love are woven through the film resulting in a complex, thought-provoking human drama.",1

60647," The movie itself is unfulfilling. It just hangs there, like the aftertaste of stale beer.",0
74052," Clever yet sincere, a masterful Theron performance, and it balances it light and shade pretty well. Just don't see it if you're thinking about having kids.",1

248353," This young, talented filmmaker has as much muscle as he has heart and brains.",1
230495," Would be a prominent piece of low-budget filmmaking if had appeared a decade or so ago, but by now the genre is so tired, the glorification of violent criminals so prosaic, that it rates simply as an also-ran.",0
14228," Part of the filmmakers' point is that any old nutcase might be lurking behind the drawn curtains of the house next to you in just such an anonymous locale. Still makes for a mighty limiting, boring place to set a movie, though.",0
41737, Only two characters might qualify as sympathetic.,0
160828," I can't recall a documentary shaped quite this way. Dennis handles it with integrity, and the effect is painful and deeply moving.",1
105913," I like the cast, I like the epic feel. It satisfied me in a way that Thor 1 did not.",1
205490," ""Shot"" would have you believe there's a moral to this fable. But suggesting that the solution to the problem of gun violence is as simple as one of Aesop's fables only adds insult to injury.",0

146954, It subverts the wishy-washy movie these films tend to turn into.,1
113820, Moments that hint at a psychedelic revelation to come never add up to much. Only in the last scene does the film seem to make good on the promise of its title.,0
199789, The method to the madness behind Shoot 'Em Up is etched in stone from a surreal popcorn perspective drenched in cynicism and silliness.,1
40854," [Coppola] ignites a long, long dramatic fuse on this art house project, sumptuously rendered by director of cinematography Philippe Le Sourd in ethereal natural light, be it from a woozy, filtered sun or a soft, glowing candle.",1
133269, The Resident Evil franchise as a whole [is] so profoundly past its sell-by date that every sequel feels like a nostalgic revival of something that never actually went away.,1
64592," Essentially this movie is about giving an old man his dignity, which is found through letting him play out an embarrassing misunderstanding, letting someone figure that out for themselves is more respectful than ""saving"" them from it by stepping in. ",1
196432," Even by the rock-bottom standards of dance movies, the script is abysmal: formulaic and dumb.",0
35582," Statham has become something of a poor man's James Bond via this international action smorgasbord franchise, and frankly, I'm all for it.",1

172038, A small treasure for avant-garde fans.,1
57357," Hardcore Henry is definitely hardcore - an adrenaline-fueled, ultra-violent, one-of-a-kind experience that stands as the closest thing to a live-action video game that you'll ever see. Too bad it's not any good.",0

194007," Utterly engaging, a transporting bit of cinema that immerses viewers -- uncomfortably at times -- in a riveting detective story.",1
47389," She's inexhaustible, seemingly everywhere at once and, throughout director Sara Hirsh Bordo's unblinking, well-directed film, she is absolutely and fearlessly herself. Which is exactly as it should be -- the world needs Lizzie Velasquez.",1
52952, An exercise in product-placement so blatant it makes the last Transformer outing seem subtle by comparison.,0
64692," ...most of the pleasures the movie offers are visceral, from the silken roar of character actor McHattie's FM shock jock voice and the bloody meltdown of a production assistant to the bizarro epilogue appended to the credits.",1

45358," Not as audacious as Memento, Christopher Nolan's first studio feature is nevertheless a confident and intelligent thriller that demonstrates a canny ability to fuse his own concerns with guilt, subjective experience and narrative to a mainstream package.",1
219409," For all the preoccupation on external artifice and style, there's also a poetic core to the proceedings.",1
206856," Whether we're lawyering up or narrating the drama of a night's play, it's hard to miss Sorkin's writing, but he has yet to find an equivalently distinctive style behind the camera.",1
62096," Smith's performance is terrific, but it's in service of a clumsy, heavy-handed film that believes the ultimate measure of a man is how hard he chases what he desires - wealth, fame, Oscars.",0

28330," It's the single most harmless teen movie in the recent cinematic landscape, and also one of the most charmingly fun.",1
132793," If you think of 'Half-Blood Prince' and the two 'Deathly Hallows' entries as a trilogy that concludes the Potter saga, 'Part 1' is a terrific middle, a quietly thrilling and artful chapter.",1

60667," On top of its historical significance, Crazy Rich Asians is a great movie, period. I laughed, I cried, sometimes both at the same time. Thanks Jon M. Chu and the phenomenal cast, it's such a joyful experience that's both funny AND romantic. ",1
209181," It's particularly nice to see Schwarzenegger get the chance to take on a more nuanced role than what he normally gets. He does well with it, too. It's just not enough to sustain a whole movie. A really good short film: Yes.",0

242140," Dennison is a marvel, completely unself-conscious in his portrayal of a kid who is lost but thinks if he acts tough, it'll look like he's found. Neill, playing a different sort of character for him (quiet, unfriendly), is also outstanding.",1

58578," Although the movie maintains a certain level of interest, at times it feels thoroughly scattershot, especially in dealing with its characters.",0
106693," This is the kind of movie where you squirm out of enjoyment, not terror, and it's probably going to be popular with younger audiences - it doesn't pound you over the head with violence.",1

148205," It may still move at hectic speed from one gargantuan punch-up to the next, but - under the direction of Joe and Anthony Russo - it's well paced for the sort of extravaganza it is. The all-star parade never becomes a pile-up.",1

76334, Can this be done in a way that is not stupefyingly generic?,0
21117, If you want my opinion-and I am way outside (think Pluto) the intended audience-forget this often crass effort about the double-headed love gymnastics involving BFFs in the Big Apple. It's just not all that appealing a rom-com.,0

20629," It's deeply perceptive about what good actors do, without resorting to theatrical platitudes.",1
91446," Chereau shot Intimacy in Super 35mm widescreen, but the film has the scruffy look of 16mm or digital video. That is not a bad thing, but, instead, the perfect representation of this downbeat drama -- desperate, sad, and shabby.",0

140569," The narrative takes a surprising turn, leading to a troubling and, I think, successful third act. Most uneven pictures have a way of fading to gray in the final lap; this one actually gets better as it goes.",1
24021," The movie's motives might be admirable, but its execution is so bogged down in impenetrable old-white-guy self-pity that the real problems facing public education and its practitioners get buried in the wallow.",0

2031," It doesn't take long to realize that Ridley Scott's adaptation is only aiming for certain forms of credibility, and callously eschewing others. ",0
180465," It's filled with the kind of embarrassing situations that only happen in movies and would probably make the viewer ashamed to watch it, if they weren't too busy cracking up laughing. ",1

26590," For its courage to address a ticklish subject with warmhearted humor, Breakfast With Scot, adapted from a novel by Michael Downing, deserves a light round of applause.",1

189282, Even those invested in the idea that the journey is the destination may feel they've taken a train to nowhere.,0

147196," It's unfortunate that the set pieces feel a little derivative of Raimi's films, but that was always likely to be the case given the close proximity of this new film to its predecessors.",1
459," The ambition is evident throughout, but the execution just doesn't have enough energy to sustain it. THUNDERBALL is very sluggish.",0
200332, A group of people old enough to remember VHS parties may very well have flashbacks of the old days - for better and for worse - should they visit The House of the Devil.,1

200602," Why Me? sputters around the 90 minute mark, when raunchy ideas and even the funniest execution often expires. Before then, Cranston and Franco earn plenty of guilty laughs, doing what they do, one less often than the other.",1
189352, Unusual animated fable - about a courageous mouse that saves a kingdom - suffers from an over-abundance of story but has its heart in the right place.,1
159285," You could see the film as the making of Crazy Dog Lady or as the story of a bereaved woman finding her true passion in life. Personally, I lean toward the former.",0
177232," The finale, in which Lionel reduces a horde of flesh-eaters to a mulch of blood, flesh and offal with the aid of a flymo, is probably the goriest scene ever.",1

1687," A good performance from Breslin keeps tension alive, but hope for a really scary and inventive fright dies screaming in the basement.",0
164223," Hardwicke, whose first ""Twilight"" film looks like ""Citizen Kane"" with fangs compared to this, takes things sooo seriously, which translates as buffoonery.",0

35140," This freaky, nightmarish ride down Mulholland Drive thrilled me beyond rational explanation",1
183398, Just another grisly puzzle with no agenda except to convince us that hell would look pretty good after spending almost two hours in this hole.,0
175028, More than parodying private peccadillos is needed to turn apparently twisted trysts into a smart sex comedy.,0
1643, One of the worst movies thus far this year.,0

24870, Not the worst movie ever made -- no thanks to Latifah.,0
136241," Laughably predictable, far too tempered to generate any tearjerking stakes worth caring about.",0

145171," Yet Garner shines, and with a deft supporting cast of comedically talented character actors and assured direction by director Gary Winick (The Tic Code), 13 Going on 30 comes up pretty much a winner.",1
233848," Sleek, beautiful and packed with emotion, not too flashy but full of heart, this is a movie worthy of its unlikely yet glorious subject.",1
154080," You end up with a movie that is way too simple-minded for adults on an ABA nostalgia trip, and way too dirty for kids.",0
246312, Sokurov has great ability to get us interested in what's happening in spite of his unconventional narrative. [Full review in Spanish],1

51692, There's something new to be discovered in every viewing of The Exorcist.,1
107814, Despite working from extraordinary subject matter-Edgar Allan Poe's various tales of the macabre-too many entries in this animated anthology are disappointingly ordinary.,0
132604," A mean-spirited satire, told in mock-tabloid style, this film features the best performance of Nicole Kidman to date (better than The Hours for which she won an Oscar), as an amoral small-town girl obsessed with becoming a TV star.",1
250205," Due Date is just like 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' but without the humor and heart.",0

125131, Nothing seems to matter and yet everyone tells us how much is at stake.,0
122444, The script is all over the shop. It's very clunkily put together. ,0
21097," But the last third is a disaster, everything that happens both asinine and illogical, and by the time it was over I could have cared less about any of the characters, their plight or if the killer was going to be stopped one smidgen of a single bit.",0
182471," Unlike Prometheus, which I found I enjoyed a lot more than the general consensus, this was as bad if not worse than its reputation. Let's just leave Alien alone for a while...",0
49478," ""The Lone Ranger"" is a frustrating exercise in overkill, a kind-of, sort-of interesting idea buried in summer-movie excess.",0
164252," Well-produced and well-acted middlebrow entertainment, a political ""expose"" that will shock only pearl-clutchers and naive dopes. ",1

203713, can't quite get over the inertia of its failings,0
178120," The film even manages things neatly at the end: we get a mixture of closure and openness, in which things are rounded off, yet there's still the possibility of another adventure.",1
155726," Garrel's gaze is cool and steady, and he's not interested in villains. He knows this is an old story and an eternal one, and that men and women are helpless to avoid repeating it.",1
66946," An actress who suggests religious piety, carnal fire and satanic aggression with equal dexterity, Ms. Bell provides a pulse an audience can connect with amid the standard-issue atmospheric accouterments. ",1
29277," The candid interviews put a human face on the conflict and convey a harrowing sense of hopelessness about the rampant violence and corruption, though it lacks cohesion.",1
94286," Even with a brief running time, 'College Road Trip' is an ordeal that even its target audience will find dispiritingly lame.",0
165080, [Year One has] some very funny moments but not enough of them.,0

44812," Essentially the picture is one tease after another, misdirecting as fast as it can and amounting to the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" vacuousness of mid-period M. Night Shyamalan. ",0

116682, As mean-spirited as movies come!,0
220325," The plot is too foreordained in every detail to be genuinely gripping, and the action far too shoddy in both conception and execution, which is even worse.",0
84705, It's hard not to find Happy Death Day 2U a little exhausting and empty.,0
23064," A silly comedy-thriller that is amiable enough, but with a rather higher body count than laugh quotient.",0
102006," As much fun as it is, Ragnarok, by treating everything as an opportunity for a goof, forfeits any chance of taking root in your imagination. Nothing matters here.",0
139986, I kept waiting for those guys from Mystery Science Theater to pop up in the corner of the screen.,0
148556," Dunkirk is the film Nolan has been building to his entire career. It's his masterpiece, it's the best film of the year so far, and it's the one to beat come awards time.",1
119100," In doing some constructive nip/tuck and staging the musical numbers in splashy old-musical style, Shankman has put some of the bang back into the genre.",1
172377, An animated film about a magical world that casts an enchanted spell of its own.,1
204681," A thrilling journey commanded by one-dimensional humans, in the hands of Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, to discover exciting beasts. Full review in Spanish]",1

131581," Rodriguez only needs the script to take us from one gimmick to the next, and his lack of attention to it shows.",0
153008," There is nothing overwhelmingly bad about the finished product, but there is also nothing, save for a performance or two, that inspires the viewer to sit up and take notice.",0
132795," Berlin Syndrome progresses slowly, never dramatically gratuitous or exploitative of the inherent drama of its story.",1
246642, The smartly written and layered script calls out prudish and toxic attitudes towards sex workers.,1
37181," Deep, rich sound accompanies distressed, often unfocused black-and-white shots of nighttime winter streets, garishly lit interiors and archival footage. Splashes of color in cut-out animation segs add to the texture.",1
164165, Thrilling tale of heroism during deadly oil rig explosion. ,1
72764, The film is mistaken to the point of perversity about the nature of imagination when it comes to a poet and especially to this poet.,0
131538," The Na'vi consider seeing, in the sense of grok or ken, to be fundamental in tribal life and in navigating Pandora. If you allow yourself to see Avatar as it was meant, you will love it as I did. I can't wait to go there again.",1
90717," All in all, Finding Dory is exactly what a great sequel should be - like the original, only better.",1
132524, Smith's performance is definitely on par with Julia Roberts' in Erin Brockovich.,1
190200," Maddening and charismatic, Steve doesn't so much develop as he represents, vividly and terribly, a complicated geometry of success.",1
221791, A film that is less a fully developed portrait of its subject than it is a rough snapshot that conveys the immediacy of the times in a more gripping manner than most of the current crop of fictional films on the subject.,1
179972, Everything Rankin/Bass did works perfectly here. The guest voice (Fred Astaire) is dead on. The filling in of mythology around a holiday figure is just great. And even the song the special builds toward is one of the better Santa Claus songs out there.,1
139710, Hawking's innovations and refusal to subscribe to outdated modes of thinking merely underscore the utter conventionality of his film biography.,0
127908, Its story's third-act inversions still provide a pointed rebuke to superhero narratives' set-in-stone dynamics.,1

168567, makes me cry every time,1
66166," Nichols's cut, gutted version (of Aaron Sorkin's script) offers a few cheery, breezy moments of rat-a-tat comedy, but Charlie Wilson's War stops being funny when you realize we're living in the sequel.",0
154281," A highly entertaining B-movie that's smarter than it looks, and there's a real sense of glee both from the writer-director and the star that makes it a lot of gruesome fun.",1
164286," This movie is an absolute joy. Fans of ... Jackman should definitely check (this) out, showcasing the talented actor in an exciting return to his musical roots. ",1
47235," Movies like this need to be airtight, but ""Gringo"" is a flimsy piece of pulp fiction.",0
247286," Tweel's approach is no-frills, with much of the footage having been shot by Gleason and his wife Michel. This is wise: The story itself is so wrenching that any attempt to gussy it up would run the risk of feeling overwrought, even manipulative.",1
188377," Unendurably boring in its superfluousness, its ersatz feel accentuated by a plethora of digital effects, Undead is simply a stiff",0
227550," Though the more politically correct will want to be righteously offended at the on-screen antics and certifiable bad taste slapping us in the face, there's just enough truth and bite in the script to mollify those concerns.",1
236695," Clever, funny but emotionally stunted. Like most teenagers. ",1
14603," The film succeeds to some extent as a pure stylistic exercise, with a few fine Lynchian moments blurring reality with erotic and violent fantasies.",1
186270," Without an intriguing adversary for Capt. Jean-Luc Picard and crew, it's all for naught.",0
184408, About as cutting-edge as Pet Rock: The Movie.,0
88332," Like a visit from amusing friends who stay a bit longer than expected, it's easy to forgive the indulgence.",1
132261," It's simply a mediocre film, stuffed with filler dialogue and a surfeit of slow-motion closeups substituting for any real character development. ",0
150471," M Night Shyamalan has fashioned a modern classic here, a chilly, intelligent, emotional ghost story that relies not on the obligatory gore and knifeplay for its many shocks but on glimpses of an afterlife that's anything but angels and harps.",1
164270," (The) disturbed and disturbing psycho-horror nightmare begins as a gentle romance based on a lie and then shoots into the Twilight Zone of obsession, sadism, and mutilation.",1
144607, A spectacular display of stunts and adrenaline.,1
32262, The smashing opening sequence from 2001: A Space Odyssey fleshed out to hit blockbuster beats,1
193357," Garrel is content to offer yet another sketch of interpersonal problems. The fixation hasn't quite outstayed its welcome, but like the couple at the movie's center, suffers from the whiff of staleness.",1
220924," A winning, inspirational crowd-pleaser à la Hidden Figures, Leder's film follows the early accomplishments of the young Ginsburg (an assured Felicity Jones, convincingly slipping into the trailblazer's shoes), beginning in 1956.",1
21894," De Mornay seems to have found her true vocation playing the nanny from hell, but while the ensuing thrills may well be enjoyed by many, anyone with offspring of their own would be wise to stay away.",0
244339," Is it a satire? A black comedy? A tragic parable? A comic book set in the real world? Gunn doesn't seem to want to commit to any of them, and no one in the film seems to know either. ",0
174725," For all its strengths, Albert Nobbs has its weaknesses; director Rodrigo Garcia often allows the film to seem stilted and the story doesn't fully satisfy",1
62727," The best thing ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" has going for it is director J.A. Bayona, who takes a mediocre script by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow and directs the living daylights out of it. ",1
47178," You go to a Roland Emmerich film for global destruction, not international casting. And Independence Day: Resurgence doesn't disappoint.",1
111748," Another summer, another Pixar feature, another masterpiece.",1
182786," Joe Carnahan shows how the film's titular bad-ass heroes become rogue fighters, but takes an age to do so. The TV show's opening credits managed the same feat in around 20 seconds.",0
102219," It takes a personal rather than a political perspective, exploring the ambiguities of truth and individual identity rather than the complexities of an ongoing historical calamity.",1
176005," We've laughed at Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler in lots of movies, but audiences will barely chuckle at their latest film, The House, a hot mess of lame jokes and weak writing.",0
126715," Few [war movies] are as moving as Days, but even so, this film doesn't romanticize. It's hard, clear, full of empathy for its characters and lucid in its insight into their plight.",1
161075," There is a simple sweetness about this film when it sticks to the likable Carell, God and his family, but it's overcome by the deluge of effects that pay homage to Hollywood's sole focus of worship: the box office.",0
244090, A sober look at an area more typically relegated to horror movies.,1
30862," It's a movie every bit as messy as its ""hunny""-craving bear, though only somewhat as lovable. ",1

244527, A model of what films like this should be like.,1
134947," Mostly, ""Marigold Hotel"" is old-fashioned, safe and resistant to stray from its comfort zone -- like visiting a foreign country and only eating the foods you already know you like.",0
63417," Almodóvar plants a foot on each side of the gap between the two [styles], which is fine, but the film, like Julieta herself, seems lost on the road.",0

180534," I don't know how it happened, or what Simon West was thinking, but the first half of Con Air is brilliant and the second half is a non-stop climax, and a dimwitted one at that.",0
195606," Not usually seen as one of the cinema's great romantics, Visconti with ""Senso"" made a film that both celebrated and mocked the very idea of romantic love, and the film remains resolutely itself after all these years.",1

147561, [Comes] across as the sort of standard police procedural that might serve as the pilot for a television series.,0

166307," Though a clearly gifted new filmmaker, Lugacy doesn't get a handle on the combustible material, and she gets scalded in the process.",0
147812," Hopefully there will be many more films to come featuring trans performers in leading roles, and ""Woman"" can be looked back on as a well-meaning but flawed effort that paved the way.",0

107884, Sour Grapes is an absorbing documentary that feels like a drama as the story unravels. ,1
78606," It unquestionably sparkles visually and the very youngest kids will still enjoy it, but between Cars 2 and particularly Pixar's three previous features stands a wide chasm of quality. ",0
132656, Meta-irony can get a guy who's still grinding an ax only so far.,0
43832," It's like discovering a new formula to reach a similar result. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is slightly darker in tone and less campy than the ""Spider-Man"" films. Visually stunning, emotional, and intelligent; ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" lives up to its name. ",1

196932," It's hard stuff to watch, but the movie was written and filmed so smartly and with such boldness, with just the right ironic edge, that it counters the urge to bolt.",1
9901," Okay, but it lacks conviction.",1
245653," A spooky enigma, more ponderous than provocative, more silly than suspenseful.",0

50869, You might like this film better if you think exploding heads is a funny bit.,0
122312," Distraught father avenges his dead son, sparking a drug war in rural Norway. Scandinavian Death Wish is a strong vehicle for a superb Stellan Skarsgård.",1

107756," Russell Tovey gives a layered, career-best performance in an intense interior drama that never quite shakes its theatrical origins.",1
71765," Unlike most silly fantasy superhero movies, this one is not set in a fictional locale with fictional characters. No, it's Wonder Woman winning WWI! It is the same intellectual diarrhea of all the others, only worse, minimizing the horrors of WWI.",0

63398," If anything, it feels like 'What's Your Number?' is the worst version of what 'Bridesmaids' could have been. It just doesn't heart, and every joke feels completely forced and obvious.",0
86438, Is it a psychological thriller or a giddy horror of the evil-in-them-there-hills persuasion? This split-personality number can't quite decide.,0

110193, Smith is more likable the less he tries to make us like him.,1

176191, The Canyons rapidly evolves into a film hopelessly at odds with itself.,0

232357," Barrie's Neverland is a bubble bath with endless castles, clouds and caves waiting to be explored. Forster's is a relaxing hot tub, which is also nice, but not the same thing.",0
222281, It fails to make its subject matter interesting.,0
169970," It's impossible to ignore that you are looking at unspeakable cruelty which, even if justifiable, must be ruinous to the soul of the wielder. You expect that to become the theme of the film, but, astonishingly, it never does. ",0

182943, The formal mechanisms are so obvious and impersonal that they flatten our modes of thinking and feeling almost as much as the propaganda films that a regime like East Germany's would have approved.,0
226014, This action movie misses the two big chances here: to play with the absurdities of its premise and to make a comment on corporate greed. Instead it's just brutally violent and staggeringly stupid.,0

42930," Directed with tremendous energy for much of its first half, as Cannon starts to wear out is welcome, so does this documentary.",0
51691," Since the supposed romance between Sky Captain and Polly is so unsatisfying and the visuals are so flagrantly abundant, I'm assuming this movie is for boys. ",1
154105," Offers a cheap (relatively speaking -- ticket prices aren't what they used to be), stress-free, vicarious vacation.",1
13816," Marion Cotillard's Lady Macbeth, however, is a triumph. She seems transfixed by her own capacity for evil, and her mad scene is one of the most unhistrionic, and therefore spookiest, ever filmed.",1
11407," A slightly faster pace, a better ending, and a few twists we haven't seen time and time again would have made Pride and Glory a must-see.",1
70335," Their uncertain flirtation and growing affection feel authentic, and their situation is bound to remind viewers of similar circumstances in their own lives.",1
28407," Nina's presence is symptomatic of problems that exist in the entire film, which favors oddly disconnected scenes that never truly gel together, leading to a take-it-or-leave-it approach.",0
184235, Dizzying and powerful.,1
158530," You'll find yourself rooting for computer-generated robots that magically transform into cars, trucks and fighter planes. It's selling the movie short to say the special effects are amazing -- they are out of this world.",1

78050, Jaglom seems unable to decide whether he wants it to be a character mosaic or a psychological nightmare ...,0
75286," Above all else, this documentary is about an individual's relentless impulse to create. It's about never giving up. And in this sense I'd argue that it is the most fascinating of the three films. ",1
23809, Repeated praise of Mr. Harmon's nerdy fan base keeps emphasizing how appreciative its members are for his shining a light. Little splurts from an ingratiating score nudge us along.,0
37857, The performances sing.,1
260," For sure, Death Cure reaches further than its grasp in a vain attempt to close the story on a meaningful note, but who can really blame this gaggle of murder-teens for trying to pretend like all the murdering they did meant something?",0
242256," It's beautifully shot, even if the painting often feels incidental.",1
61446," By the time we reached the climactic and fantastically over-the-top showdown, I realized that while the characters were indeed trying to corner the market on smoldering glances, faux-Shakespearean proclamations and in-your-face symbolism.",1
118844," Too much flat love interest, too much love triangle, and three stock-character grown-ups are in the end too much baggage for 'The Children of Huang Shi.'",0

145567, McKay's latest work of art is an ode to those who fight for that glimmer of hope this country claims.,1

163994," Based on the classic series of children's books by Margret and HA Rey, this gently comical animated movie perfectly catches the tone of the adventure tales. It's a charming little film that shouldn't be left to children.",1

139000," Impressively tracks a family phenomenon via media mind controlled ditto-heads, brainwashed staged interventions, angry white men, and drive time as the geography of destiny. But lacks further scrutiny into shadow corporate complicity and a tanked economy.",1

25097," This odd, disturbing film is visceral but ultimately unsatisfying.",0
199055," [T]here's a lot of problems with the script, and some of the stuff with Edward Herrmann I don't think works at all, it's not funny it just kind of falls flat. But Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, I think they deliver enough to say it's worth seeing.",1

132073," Nostalgia, penned by Alex Ross Perry, repeatedly spelled out each of its themes: It's a bit insulting for viewers, all of whom can likely process such a universal topic as grief and loss, and it drags down the narrative.",0
2113," Kids won't mind any of The Tooth Fairy's flaws and will find the sight of burly Johnson in a pink tutu hilarious. Parents get a couple of clever gags that will make them forgive the filmmakers. And if we all remember to floss, everybody wins.",1

97621, A derivative but diverting thriller featuring relatively subdued turns by Anthony Hopkins and Al Pacino.,1
242690, Peaceful Warrior is an inspirational story of the making of a true athlete. It's a bit hokey but you get by that whenever [Nick] Nolte is on the screen.,1
215116, The first 15 minutes of this picture had me rolling in the aisles. The careful animation of the frog-king rocks. Not so funny during middle chunk. Great pop-music choices!,1
229293, The real problem is that Annie veers dangerously close to being unlikeable although Kristen Wiig's performance is so winning that she just about gets away with it. ,1

250538," Lee's best, most cohesive and most passionate film since Do the Right Thing.",1
206109," The film has some vague things to say about class and racial differences, but they are drowned out by the sounds of blasting shotguns and huge knives being plunged into chests.",0
207818," The action here, both with and without Chan, is outstandingly staged, with much credit needing to go to director Campbell, who also helmed Brosnan's debut as James Bond in ""Goldeneye"" as well as Daniel Craig's amazing Bond reboot ""Casino Royale."" ",1
150075, The lesson here is never to aim to make a great movie before locking in the framework for a good one.,0

107934, There's a fine line between old-fashioned and cliched.,0

109837," The whole thing makes Winter's Bone look as cheerful as a Li'l Abner strip, and there's something distastefully condescending about it. ",0
193327," It's a handsomely made film but too ploddingly paced to be engaging, dousing its spark in a sea of didactic dialogue.",0
202528," Clearly about the curse of celebrity culture but also hamfisted and confused. If you like nasties, this is very nasty indeed.",0
127735, Dead Antis the kind of movie that owes its success largely due to its actors' willingness to embrace the film's absurdities.,1
83932," The sepia-toned freeze frames that introduce each character with their names, occupations and life expectancy are a lot of fun, but ultimately the action is cut too fast and too close to be able to tell what's going on.",0
100721," If it all sounds melodramatic, [Antonio Mendez] Esparza's rigorously unsentimental approach always pulls back form that brink. The film's style is, like its guarded characters, watchful. ",1

40081, It is entertaining and there is ultimately a poignancy in an artist addicted to perfectionism.,1

4767," Marvel's ambitious plan has taken one more step, and it has yet to take a false one.",1
66006, This is not a stupid comedy. A comedy with this many elements has to be smartly structured and blended.,1
136389, Maybe some of its ambition got lost in translation?,0
145147, [An] urgent and compassionate thriller about the vicious cycle of aggression and revenge.,1
178607, A decent vehicle for Ahmed to show why he's considered one of Britain's most interesting young stars.,1
228466," Like so many of Allen's latter-day pieces, it feels like a dotty redo of Tennessee Williams's signature work or a nostalgic, aspirational nod to Eugene O'Neill and F. Scott Fitzgerald. We watch a desperate, emotionally parasitic woman seek redemption....",1

221983," Well, she's Maggie, isn't she? Magnificent to behold, terrifying, pathetic and irreproachable. There ain't nothing like that dame.",1
154312," Your Name is a cluster of films all intertwined -- teen comedy, rural drama, and that comet passing by overhead can't be good either -- and Shinkai's energetic style and vivid backgrounds make it a constant delight to watch.",1
127829, It's hard to dislike a film with such laudable ambition. But watching this feels like being kidnapped by a hippie parade.,0
157502," These are grossly uncompelling characters, written without regard for believability or intelligence.",0
152673," It's to Spielberg's credit that he wanted to tell this story, and that he and his formidable cast tell it so very well.",1
58268, The cat-and-mouse sequences in this film are revelatory -- they're why we go to the movies in the first place.,1
104072," A movie like this lives and dies on the chemistry of its leads and Luke Evans, Rebecca Hall, and Bella Heathcote are perfect together. ",1
236082," Art-house fare that, though light-hearted, should please most specialized fans.",1
158508, The film has its gimmicky aspects but Olsen is haunting: She grounds the slim premise and makes it worthwhile.,1

180398," We get close-ups, awkward camera movements, speed-up/slow-down nonsense, and shots with missing frames. I had to look away a few times because I thought I was going to have a seizure. This was NOT a fun movie to watch.",0
234650, Kate Upton busts out in buoyant debut turn.,1
125192," The action is nasty and efficiently choreographed, but Shivaay does not have the power of Taken.",0
218748," Despite some fine performances, the film has difficulty finding a consistent tone, and the well-intentioned script emphasizes melodrama and sentimentality.",0
239452," It's a comedy about things that are not funny -- suicide, drug overdoses, busted relationships -- and as long as it sticks to that stuff, Little Miss Sunshine is wonderful.",1

93364," [The] lazy, scattershot and anything-but-mature sequel to the leaden Grown-Ups.",0
152339," Like the teenagers at its center, Hot Summer Nights tries too hard to look cooler than it ever could be.",0
298," With the heyday of ""Sesame Street"" undeniably in the past, ""I Am Big Bird"" will primarily appeal to nostalgic grownups. But as Spinney demonstrates, you're never too old to be a kid at heart.",1
35963," Everyone involved in Actor Martinez deserves kudos for the effort, but the unengaging result would be better chalked up to a failed experiment rather than shared with others in theatrical settings.",0

147742," There are few films as soulful and human as Lisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right. That a film can set itself apart from the pack by merely being human is somewhat depressing, but there you have it. ",1
125228, [T]he movie not only tries to uncover the worst of its subject but also widely ignores the best.,0
98087," it is nice to see a film made for adults, with fine acting and the amusing last-minute twist that pulls the film together.",1

21388," That sensation, one that the movies rarely elicit anymore, is your heart tingling.",1
184388," Mary Shelley wants for a proper injection of Gothicism - a little less Jane Austen, a little more Ken Russell, if you will. As it stands, the sensational source material fails to scintillate as it should.",0

211315," The result is still fun and colourful, but lacking some Master Builder magic.",1

34338," Determined purists may find reasons not to like this transition to the big screen. But if it was going to happen anyway, The Adventures of Tintin is as good as we could hope for. It's beyond reproach as family fare, equally entertaining for every age.",1

190558, Affectionate retro fun that coasts on soul sounds of the '70s and Cosby Kids-styled camaraderie.,1
227683," The movie fails to make you sympathize with Thorin. I was rooting for him to fail, he'd make a wretched King. Should have been called The Hobbit: Sidequests. I felt like I was watching a Video Game or Theme Park ride pitch and not a real movie.",0

181753," Smith carries the weight of the film rather well on his broad shoulders, with a soul-felt performance that makes you feel kicked in the gut every time another lousy thing happens to this nice, hard-working, devoted dad.",1
209736," King Kong sets a new standard for action movies, and maybe for movie romances, too. You feel almost privileged to be in the presence of such an awesomely accomplished and exhilarating picture.",1
19373," If this film happens to be on, pay attention whenever Elliott comes on screen and savor his gravelly voice and well-worn features. Everything else is completely forgettable.",0

207684, The stakes seem credible because French director Christian Carion ('Joyeux Noël' ) is working from a fascinating chapter of history that's only come to light recently.,1
55102," This is not the way human beings behave. But, suspending disbelief on this, the rest of the film is very well made and it does allow some important perspectives on thorny moral issues.",1

111222," Succinct, handheld camerawork and deft performances amplify the drama's emotional clout.",1
95813, Hard to imagine a reason to see this at the cinema; its natural home is a half-arsed DVD rental accompanied by pizza and the feeling that you owe it to yourself to do better.,0
47088," Lately, romance comedies have expanded in running time, doubtless to compensate for their shrinkage in charm, and this is no exception -- it's way too long for something far too slight.",0
107473, The movie remains a great tonic.,1
62321," It's a slyly political film that wears its feminism lightly, but one that lives entirely in the empathetic careworn turn of its lead actress. ",1

155332," It's a lame, scare-free film that wants really badly to work in the vein of ""It Follows,"" but has none of the intelligence.",0
80017," If, like me, you find that the decision to be made here has an obvious solution, [it] takes it time arriving at it. But it is the way in which Ryota comes to understand the way fathers shape their sons that makes ""Like Father, Like Son"" worthwhile.",1

195041," L.A. Burning doesn't feel vital in its retelling, but gets intriguing once it moves past the riots to focus on a question hanging over the story of 1992: How does a black man reconcile these truths and survive, in this world?",1

138211," If the talk had been surgically removed, leaving only the sights and sounds of combat, this could have been a striking, semiabstract display of aggressive energy; as it is, any viewer over twelve will go for the laughs.",0
208942," When the story eventually takes a turn for sensational, Kore-eda keeps the action low-key, emphasizing the emotional responses of the family members rather than the external forces that close in around them.",1
213584, Singleton turns a typical coming-of-age yarn into the angry expression of the plight of young black males in the ghetto. This accomplished debut still represents the helmer's best work.,1
175664," The shooting style will drive many people to distraction (a four-minute opening shot of a bush, for instance, is a killer). But as an essay on motherhood, memory and the looming shadow of loss, it's close to exquisite.",1
118574," This is a fascinating, outrage-provoking story but director Per Fly's bid to turn it into a cloak-and-dagger thriller falls disappointingly flat.",0

135757," As far as acting goes, these kids certainly can dance.",0
151740, The best thing about the ultimately involving way this romantic drama ends up on screen is that it's sure to arouse enough interest to make those who don't already know the outcome more than eager to look it up.,1
241720," Lightly amusing but doggone derivative, the film bombards the audience with jokes, action and effects to produce an overstuffed experience that rarely enchants. ",0

220223, This is the rock revolution reduced to the level of the Eurovision Song Contest.,0

215416," This is the best work Cooper has done as an actor since The Silver Linings Playbook, and his directorial debut suggests the brightest of futures behind the lens. As for Gaga, well, she steals the show.",1
3112," A film that doesn't necessarily glamorise its subject, though it does seems worryingly enamoured by his achievements. This is ultimately closer to a slice of over-board entertainment than an insight into a despicable, if extraordinary man.",0

132947," Gibson dwells on the gory details of laceration -- one whipping after another and another and another -- until it's the viewer who's tortured, hurt, defensive, and, finally, numb (if not driven to retaliate).",0

59333," Underwhelming action thriller has deaths, violence.",0

237391," Xu Haofeng may have an original eye but he desperately needs a collaborator that can help convey his ideas in a much more enjoyably cinematic fashion. Hopefully his next film, he can do this but in the meantime, The Final Master is a colossal bore.",0
188548," [Personal Shopper], while never less than watchable, is disconcertingly muddled.",1
85182," Instead of melting into the holes of the story like so much warm butter, the audience gets scraped across Anderson's room-temperature toast. There's no chemical reaction, which has the effect of leaving the audience cold.",1

51927," Simplistic, silly and tedious.",0
14151," The detail is truly exhaustive. It's unclear if the film covers literally every detail leading up to the massacre but it wouldn't be surprising in the least to hear that it did. However, this approach entirely purposeful. ",1

251314," Take Fellini, Tarantino and ""Taxi Driver,"" throw 'em in a cage with a lion, and you'd get this strange, wild trip.",1
108136," This dramedy from several SNL veterans has a pretty strong case of the cutes, and it doesn't always connect, but at the same time it's genuinely imaginative and sweetly likable.",1
165796," The uneven thing [here] is John Hillcoat's direction: a tense, sustained journey through an apartment while lined up behind a bulletproof shield alternating with indulgent zooms and cuts depicting local color.",0
235717," [S]till better than ""Identity Thief"" ",0
173978, This is blatant histrionic mugging directed squarely at Oscar voters.,0
1461," Yes, I realize this is a kids' movie, but that's no excuse for short-circuiting creativity.",0
107486, A quiet heartbreaker.,1
186208," That isn't the way the history books tell it, but after seeing this overripe wonder you may prefer Tarantino's take.",1
193731," Isn't about anything more than the spy game and how to make it to the end of the board...Then, too, there is Theron, whose kind of un-performance in repose keeps breaking out into ferocious fighting that suggests a feral Jackie Chan.",1
78657," It's 'Shutter Island' in the Scottish Highlands with this initially intriguing, ultimately depressing Victorian-era madhouse drama.",0
149528," The plot has been completely changed, only the characters remain and any relationship between them and the novel is purely coincidental. What's left is incoherent nonsense.",0
38527," It is refreshing to encounter an action-adventure with a Lilliputian lightness of touch. The downside, though, is that Ant-Man seems very insubstantial fare by comparison with Iron Man, Captain America et al.",1
219234, Cars 2 feels like a rival animation studio trying to copy the Pixar formula - and failing.,0
21410, Everything studio filmmaking should be but almost never is.,1
90448," The Front Runner, a drab political drama about the former presidential candidate Gary Hart, prolongs Jason Reitman's creative slump.",0
249128," Cooper seems at once fired up by the meet-cute potential of the premise, which he nails, and stuck at a creative crossroads with the more melancholy, sepia-toned stuff that probably first drew the previously-attached Clint Eastwood's attention.",0
126103, An elegant survey of the origins of the information revolution and a shrewd analysis of how the internet has reshaped the world.,1
142086, There isn't a franchise around that matches the kids' moves in the Step Up series. We just need a better reason to dance along.,0
96260, Basically it's a half-hour Twilight Zone episode blown up to feature length.,0
115761, Why is Matthew Perry's hair orange?,1
94532, ...nothing more than a showcase for Close's admittedly stirring performance...,0
237700," The movie is unevenly paced with wild shifts in tone. It too often goes for the cheap and easy laugh. It is entertaining enough to get a passing grade, but borders on being a pilot episode for a prime-time television sitcom.",1
95372," Graduation, like all Mungiu's films, addresses the depths of the heart caught up in moral uncertainty and the choice to do wrong even when the protagonist teaches the opposite.",1
92355," If you're not fond of country music (I'm not), then Crazy Heart may sound like the kind of cracker-barrel movie you should avoid. Bridges will change your mind.",1
213430," Indie stalwarts Melanie Lynskey and Justin Long play perfect imperfect parents, but Arman Darbo and Sawyer Barth really kill it as the boys.",1
33080," ...while the film is seriously overlong, there are enough elements here to hold the interest of even the most impatient viewer.",1

220588, Weir looks at the media and what it is doing to both the viewer and the person under media scrutiny. The film also takes a playful look at the relationship between humanity and God.,1
215005, Misanthropic toddlers will be rolling in the aisles.,1
247752," This is what this film does to you: it leaves you completely drained, just like the characters in this movie. Some say that the fact that this is exhausting is a major flaw; I say it's ingenius filmmaking, not a shock from James Cameron.",1
78531," An over-sexed and overly obvious Southern Gothic potboiler transplanted to rural upstate New York, losing something in the translation. ",0
240332," Familiar, routine story about not so interesting characters.",0
14622," A fun, often funny and moving movie tribute to a store which was once integrally woven, like the particular merchandise it purveyed, into the fabric of our lives.",1
74312, An innocuously smutty road comedy starring Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston.,1
165021," In this final film, fans will get a satisfying resolution. It's an emotional and dark journey illuminated by an otherworldly performance from Jennifer Lawrence.",1
95562," Embrace of the Serpent feels special because ... it recognizes that the two subjects are deeply intertwined, even as they sometimes appear at war. ",1
229037," Good and dumb, in equal measure!",1
177000," It must be noted that the movie demands some degree of resolve from its audience, and it promises no simple resolutions in return. This will trouble some, yet one can't call its rigorously factual approach dishonest or cheaply manipulative.",1
109136," Animation has never been a more sophisticated tool for storytelling, and Persepolis takes the form in a daring direction.",1
182910," The problem is that ""Willard"" never becomes anything more than a ham-fisted revenge-of-the-nerd horror fable.",0
156348," Garbus tells his story with aplomb, placing it in the greater context of the Cold War, and also examining the human toll and anguish Fischer brought upon himself.",1
168951," ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" lives up to the hype...it gets darker than the first, and still manages to be just as funny and action-packed.",1
130652," Juliet, Naked is a hilarious adaptation of Nick Hornsby's book that centers on a quirky man's obsession with one rockstar that hinders a romantic relationship.",1
15158," What was a film worth taking the time to divine value from becomes the biggest, and most expensive, waste of time in several years.",0
188820," Salles tries to capture the immediacy and spontaneous nature of the book, using long takes and even allowing the camera to drift out of focus when a character moves about.",1
136798," It is so bad, in fact, that not only do I feel as though I have sullied the fine reputation of ""Life of Brian"" by mentioning it in the same paragraph, I fear I may have also sullied the reputation of ""Wholly Moses"" as well.",0
214544," This isn't a bad diversion, and it'll drive all the thoughts out of your head for two hours, but ultimately all you can feel is the pressure as it tries to break your heart.",0
244286," Possibly the slowest and most contemplative war film ever made, In the Fog is a delicately complex work of shifting perspectives.",1
118977," A painfully bad film ... This ridiculous art-house nonsense is supposed to be a comedy, but I never laughed nor did I ever even come close to smiling.",0
202545," A movie that replicates, step by formulaic step, the familiar and now oddly dated template of the inter-racial buddy movies of the Eighties (think 48 Hours or Lethal Weapon).",0
77843, Athina Rachel Tsangari's obvious skill can't hide the fact that her concept is one-note.,0
248168," The moments of fantasy are blissful, but underneath the romance, the whimsy, and the makeup, they are unmistakably sad.",1
150719," True, the general audiences doesn't need hours of complex biochemistry talk they won't understand, but surely there's a better way of getting around it than showing Ford sitting in a lab coat writing on a dry erase board to rock music.",0
242269," A powerful microcosm depicting the horrors of war, Doug Liman's tense drama is a heart in mouth affair, as the psychological elements shape our experience.",1
32336, Impending doom is rarely this much fun to watch.,1
197129, ...inoffensively entertaining virtually from start to finish.,1
240938," A stunning artifact, a reminder of a time when Americans of all stripes could look up to the sky and feel uncynically patriotic.",1
151559," The script is never as slick as that of The West Wing but the noble quest and fast-paced dialogue are reminiscent of it, with the cunning and darkness of House of Cards.",1

207504, Only rarely is a film this observant and tender about the ups and downs of daily existence.,1
69198, This biracial entry in the psycho-bitch stalker sweepstakes is inept and stupid but not without its base pleasures.,0
108675," Based on the true story of a Kenyan hero, this is a textbook case of what happens to a good story when it's poorly directed.",0
79013," Sex and the City 2 is the female equivalent of Transformers; a big, dumb blockbuster that doesn't require you to think very hard, if at all ... I mourn the death of four memorable television characters that used to mean something to so many.",0
14664, Director Ry Russo-Young and screenwriter Maria Maggenti are far more interested in surface appearances than substance.,0

70289, ...the film is often very entertaining and consistently engaging...,1
81016," The dialogue was almost wholly improvised, from a 12-page script. And the film doesn't look cheap, hasty, scratchy or amateurish. It looks like peak Michael Mann.",1
201730, Poor Sharon Stone. She's still big; it's the erotic thrillers that got small.,0
98173, It left me puzzled at what does all this artifice mean.,0
212881, This solidly acted film struggles to balance its portrait of life amongst the have-nots in contemporary Liege with the melodramatic aspects of a crime thriller.,1
183473, An outstanding coming-of-age story.,1
72067," Here and there, we get the imaginative and outrageous stunts this series is famous for, but mostly the movie plods along, muscling through without much life or spirit.",0

164302, One of those movies that leaves you wishing you'd spent the time doing something more interesting.,0
132426, What's most admirable about the film is the person who's been pushing for its creation the longest. Kerry Washington brings a beautifully reserved presence to Hill without stripping her of any bravery.,1

212999," Gerwig's last jaunt to Europe was in Woody Allen's feeble and disjointed To Rome With Love, and even Allen himself might acknowledge that here she is despatched across the Atlantic in a far more successful cause.",1
153648, Has just enough humour and engaging performances to prevent cramps and nausea during viewing.,0
22898," An unpleasant cartoon; another offering of gratuitous behavior from Fuqua, while Washington slowly but surely reduces his once peerless charisma to a B-movie punchline.",0

233222," Mark Wahlberg glooms about the land in the latest computer-game makeover, a noir action thriller of such scowling, benighted violence that it could send manic depressives over the edge and make newcomers to that condition of us all.",0
114305," Rao avoids high drama, and while there is humor, the film's tone is one of melancholy.",1
211740," A blunt, brutal, bloody mess of a movie that displays the full range of Gibson's skills as a chronicler of eye-watering suffering on the battlefield and his propensity for corny mythmaking off it.",0

19254," There may be worse horror films than The Bye Bye Man this year, but there will be none that shows more contempt for its intended audience.",0
73433," Being cast as Edward, the Hawtest Vampire of Them All, has, ironically, done Robert Pattinson no favors.",0
218241," John Malkovich saves Dark of the Moon, the Transformers franchise, and the very concept of the effects-driven summer movie, but he is sadly only in the film for about ten minutes.",0
157430," A riveting sit, due to the filmmaker's incredible storytelling gifts, and the cast, who articulate a dreamy series of toxic encounters with sniper-like precision, tightening Almodovar's noose with exceptional skill.",1

74826, Gaining momentum seems easy for Superman Returns. Sustaining it is another story.,1
105384," This wants to be (I think) Invasion of the Body Snatchers via Ghostbusters and Attack the Block but succeeds in being nothing but its own dreadful, pitiful, tedious self.",0
57711," The conclusion is simple. Belmonte does not want to be narrated, he wants to sink in the suicidal suffering in which he himself has decided to enter. [Full Review in Spanish]",1

235857," The film looks picturesque as can be, is well-acted, and very smartly plotted.",1
206507," The director George Amponsah embeds himself in north London to unravel the background, and the subjects of his powerful documentary are Duggan's best friends.",1
51679," If only we could sympathise with Hallam as he seems to sympathise with hunted animals, this film might engage our interest; but as it stands, the whole length of The Hunted is merely a tedious deferral of the inevitable confrontation. ",0
31383," Being a French film, there are endless jokes at the expense of the English ... and the human characters are sexier than you'd find walking around in a Pixar flick. Even Britain's Queen - quite a major character! - slouches louchely. C'est tres amusant.",1

247539," Dee Rees' film is a study of historic division, but it has such a poetically tragic sense of the characters and their limitations that it transcends the period setting.",1

106913," I imagine that the Nicholas Sparks fan base is going to eat this movie up. However, for myself, it was one of the most boring movies of the year.",0
31730," Unfortunately for You, Me and Dupree, it's easier to invest patience in people stumbling to find focus and purpose than films searching for the same things.",0

194968," Daring and dirty, making it so delicious.",1
139622," The action thriller The Mummy, meant to be the Big Bang of Universal's new ""Dark Universe"" franchise, is something of a wet firecracker, more a corporate-driven branding exercise than a living, breathing movie of its own.",0

39872," It's so energetically acted and casually funny, you might not even notice that it never quite comes together.",1

90569, Maybe Just See the Documentary It's Based On?,0
183313," What I like best about The Hate U Give, which was adapted from a bestselling YA novel by Angie Thomas, is how firmly it keeps its focus on its young heroine. ",1
39556," As a mixture of drama, humor and history, a mélange of seriousness and slapstick, real people and imagined characters, it definitely stands out.",1

210734," Although both Hvam and Christensen are willing to quite literally bare all in the name of comedy, the blue streak is tempered with more subtle, character-based bits ...",1
106386," It's a blisteringly funny movie, with positive social reforms on display but take it with a huge grain of salt because it is a liberal fantasy from an idealist desperate for answers.",1
66915," 'Lame!' would be a better title for this utterly unmemorable remake of Alan Parker's edgier, darker, remarkably fresh 1980 multi-Oscar-winner.",0
94986," Director Susanne Bier's fans will be especially disappointed by the story's lack of focus and abrupt character development, flaws absent in her far superior films like After The Wedding, and In A Better World. ",0
228033," As a throwaway Friday night pizza time killer, this redneck comedy is a funny enough caper lark. Apparently based on a true story.",1
170925," Is to baseball what ""Slap Shot"" was to hockey.",1
243600," Robin plays the role of the killer with chilling logic and reason, which makes his performance all the more disturbing.",1
138329, A mega-laugh comedy about the messiness of change with lovable characters whose humor and flawed humanity make them very appealing.,1
113039, Pokemon is more of a worldwide phenomenon than a movie.,0
9193," In the playing, ""Professor Marston"" is both a breakthrough and fairly stodgy.",1
64029, Chekhov would be appalled.,0
36950," There is nothing, nothing, nothing original about Made of Honor.",0
111419, Despite the solid performances - and an admittedly intriguing final 10 minutes - Ender's Game is an underwhelming sci-fi that makes poor use of its thought-provoking material.,0
168557," The message is wrapped in facile video-game imagery, snarky commentary and simplistic sequences in which Spurlock enjoys the hospitality of Muslim families who decry terrorism and remind him that the Koran preaches hospitality and confidence.",0
99466, Although it is sumptuous to look at - albeit also extremely gory at times...the narrative can sometimes be confusing and the melodrama can seem exotically over the top.,0
102805, The film manages a neat trick of sticking close to formula while still being unexpectedly fresh.,1
13662," With its accent on character, it feels more like a comfy novel than a movie.",1
247982, The mind wonders to what a more confrontational or flippant filmmaker would have done with this material.,0
198322," Makes a good case for the constructiveness of working out the questions, issues, and problems one faces in life through the output of art.",1
230276," Familiar contemporary spin on the ""Let's make it in the music biz"" sub-genre benefits from an adoring abundance of downtown New York locations and another committed performance from Mark Ruffalo as a seriously distressed former label big shot.",1
179829," While it certainly meanders at times, even lacking dramatic punch, The Giants still stands tall when it needs to.",1
52364, There are some sweet early scenes establishing the characters' rapport... but Gordon and Nanjiani are so enamored of the standup-comedy world that it takes nearly 40 minutes for an actual conflict to be brought up.,0
179285," It's quite a good film, and well-worth seeing even if you don't normally go for this type of thing.",1
243479," It's both dull and preposterous, which neither Dean Semler's somberly handsome score nor Jeff Beals' pushy, cornball score does anything to ameliorate.",0
237361," The film is, in some ways, worse than I make it sound.",0
230408," ""Blair Witch"" runs only eight minutes past the original, yet it feels about a half-hour longer.",0
73347, Kawasi builds on the simple metaphorical significance of the set-up to tease out a much deeper and more compassionate study of the way our natural inclination to shun the marginalised in society diminishes us as a whole.,1
89305," It is a film destined to polarize. Many will hate it. Hopefully more will love it, or at least allow room for it, for its raw brutality, its extremes, its difficult truths.",1
56300," Rah-rah while making a few stabs at humanizing humor, the movie also gives both credit and hints of complexity to our Afghan allies. This is no thinking man's war movie, but it is almost thoughtful for something like that.",1
31182, Nothing but a blur...,0
45020," A magnificently executed comic fantasy. After watching a parade of hamburger hail, ice cream snowball fights, and Jell-O kingdoms, the film is sure to leave viewers starving upon exit. Armageddon never looked so delicious.",1
27434, Halfway through and I'm looking for my own escape. ,0
26378," This is exactly the type of historical dramatization that Hollywood loves to churn out, but Sully doesn't feel like merely a paycheck. Like much of latter-day Eastwood's work, this is another flawed but thoughtful effort.",1
250278," The fact that the characters spout snappy, profane dialogue while all this is, or isn't, going on around them is more ""fun"" than fun; Araki's like the too-drunk guy who won't go home when the party's over.",0
239140," keep[s] thing fast-moving and flashy but also take[s] plenty of time to bomb us adults out there with humor, both visual and intellectual (sort of), making this outing loads of fun.",1
139975, ...dull and interminable...,0
184404, The movie looks and feels exactly how it probably was to make: like a walk in the park.,1
65102, A historical costume drama - with far more emphasis on the 'costume' than the 'drama.' And there's no excuse for such a deafening score!,0
203445," If only one thing should be taken away from this film, it's that the Streep acting genes will surely live on for a long time to come through the superb Mamie Gummer",1
81069," The shape of Transit becomes close to that of a double helix, in which the convoluted managerial processes of immigration become intertwined in the recursive patterns of desire. ",1
82948, This is one of the better movies in recent years to address issues of racial inequality and the way in which individuals overcome them.,1
152595," ""Disorder"" is a miss. It takes too long to get going and when it finally does, the investment in anything that's happening isn't very high. ",0
250920," ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a defining accomplishment for Cianfrance. Those 47 days filming in Schenectady really paid off.",1
50582," Like a good politician, The Ides of March promises more than it delivers. ",1
162345," Even by vigilante film standards, this is a film with a really nasty streak that ultimately left me cold.",0
92046, The story of AA Milne and the creation of Winnie The Pooh should warm the heart and bring a tear to the eye but there are only fleeting moments when it hits the mark.,0
156802, Sacha Gervasi's broadly enjoyable pop-art biopic about Alfred Hitchcock and the making of Psycho ...,1
53261, A whimsical and light-hearted spin on a serious story of corporate whistleblowing.,1
212171," This dramatization of a true story is long on sentiment, short on character and drama.",0
103590," Aside from a few fun kinks, the movie plays as a fleetingly stylish but mostly generic maniac-on-the-loose movie. ",0
108145," There's a marvelous masked tango to ""Bust Your Windows"" and an adorable nod to screen legends as they dance along a sidewalk. ",1
98836," The film's storyline has more in common with Manos, The Hands of Fate than the original House of Wax.",0
55493," The Japanese movie is tranquil, smoothly connecting its scenes with gradual pans from one image to the next, accompanied by spare music that sounds like early morning and loneliness.",1
186523," Holland has said that she wanted her harrowing and rewarding epic to run long so it would make viewers feel that they're in the sewers as well. In this, she succeeds.",1
15593," ""Pitch Perfect"" has some legitimately funny moments.",1
38952, Sitting through this movie is like watching a dog running in circles chasing its tail -- the amusement factor dies quickly as the situation become repetitive.,0
24582," This is a messy disaster at which you can only scratch your head and mutter, ""What were they thinking?""",0
195745," ""Maggie"" appears as though it was shot through a variety of Instagram filters - a dusty grey for the exteriors, and a warm, oversaturated orange for the interiors. Also, even at a brisk 95 minutes, the runtime feels like a stretch.",0
125600," ""Bridesmaids"" is first and foremost a showcase for Wiig, who surely doesn't play it safe here but still comes off as an affable everywoman with a twinkle of danger in her eye.",1

249099," Girls Trip is everything you want out of an R16 buddy-reunion movie. It is truly funny, touching when it needs to be, relentlessly filthy and gleefully puerile at times. But it is also something more.",1
196853," Black Panther's important and timely, but more than that it's a hugely entertaining film. ",1
130245, A Disney fable savvy enough not to let its sincerity get in the way of its zippy multimedia charm.,1

218934," During the last part of this wacky comedy, it loses the amusing push-pull intimacy between its 'odd-couple' protagonists.",0
28347," ""John Dies at the End"" thinks it's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" for dudes. But in its randomness, its vulgarity and its level of humor, it's more like the collected writings on the walls of a roadside men's room.",0
108194," The first two-thirds of the film, which are like the Brothers Grimm's Greatest Hits on laughing gas, have a fizzy, fairy-dust energy.",1
221128," What do you do when you're confronted with maybe the most wonderfully strange, most magically enchanting, most heartachingly romantic movie you've ever seen?",1
180983, The script seriously miscalculates that we'll all be interested enough in its protagonist's frazzled detective quest to wait for answers to the film's central mystery.,0
247554, A baffling and frustrating disappointment.,0
70356," It lives or dies on its ending, and the final minutes here don't jibe with the rest of the film's cat-and-cat game.",0
214162," Writer-director Stephan Elliott is obviously fond of his characters, and this may account for the upbeat story line, but it blinds him to how very annoying two hours of dishing can be.",0
219871," These kids are not fighting the power, much as they or you might want to believe it.",0
58205," While the character animation is uninspired (why do these yeti have no noses?), Kirkpatrick pays homage to the physical comedy of Wile E. Coyote, uses video gaming for visual gags and gets inventive with interspecies misinterpretations.",0
245983," If you suffer from America's secret longing, you're going to have fun at The Fast and the Furious.",1
205205, I had a pretty excellent time.,1
183036, relentlessly silly,0
120882," Profound in its documentation of ... humble, indomitable survivors, Heartbound is a work of great insight, and a very engaging movie.",1
162589," It's ludicrous, but not as ludicrous as the ending -- an exhausting game of Twister that'll leave you feeling stupid or cheated or both.",0
138020, A riotous comedy from director David Wain.,1
74932, Proves Paddy Considine has a distinctive and singular vision as a filmmaker as if working with so many great filmmakers has rubbed off on him.,1
77689," With its script and storyline, I'm not certain that The Mountain Between Us could have worked well for any actors in the roles.",0
190561," ...I humbly submit that Cedric the Entertainer be required to give up the ""Entertainer"" portion of his nom de plume until he actually starts entertaining us.",0
99892, Idris Elba and Kate Winslet are both terrific actors but their skills are not enough to save this sappy mess. ,0
63759," It may not be faithful to the original book, but now kids and parents will be able to enjoy both together.",1
231772," Today's generic horror entries are superior to the cheap, poorly acted shockers from the '80s. Truth or Dare is a fine case in point.",1
199588," Were William Castle still around and involved with this film, he would have had ice strewn all over theater floors and the AC cranked to 20 degrees. As it stands, Kormakur does enough via sight and sound to turn the Everest experience into one big chill.",1
132953," ""Hot Pursuit"" features one of the worst and most forced performances of Reese Witherspoon's career, an irritating performance by Sofia Vergara(whom I love on 'Modern Family') and a seemingly endless parade of lazy and arbitrary plot twists and turns.",0
32917, While I can recommend the drama it isn't without some rather substantial reservations...,1
70587," Despite its genre-busting origin, this is simply good guys vs. bad guys material. And credit to ""Kick-Ass 2,"" you desperately root for the good guys to win.",1
169047," It's a shame the story in ""First Man,"" which on paper should be effective, is overshadowed by the film's colder aspects.",0
238019, This is really funny.,0
194526," 'Scream cheese' is right. In addition to being notably unfunny, the 3-D version of the film is like a black hole sucking all the light out of the theater.",0
190134," Hoffman and Linney are wonderful -- underplaying so perfectly that crumpled, bittersweet truths continue to surface.",1
86999," ""I know this doesn't make any sense,"" breathes Tris Prior during Insurgent's flamboyantly muddled finale, ""but you have to trust me."" You could hardly ask for a more honest line of dialogue than that.",0
26888," It's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles, but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress.",0
114549," There are wonderful little jokes hidden amid the slapstick: a perfectly delivered take on the word ""baguette"", and every line that leaves a delightfully camp Hugh Grant's mouth.",1
227873," Ultimately, Klown is just a comedy, and an excruciatingly funny one at that, even if at times it does veer into somewhat uncomfortable territory.",1
158463," In Open Season, the bad guys are such caricatures that there's just never any doubt as to the outcome.",0
202790," When the twist was revealed I went, ""Yeah, I know.""",0

67140," As documents go, this one tastes like cardboard.",0
249269, It was hard to shake the worry that a fizzy comedy about debt would be about as wrong for our current woes as uncorking a bottle of champagne. Confessions is definitely slight.,0
122434," Visually indistinguishable title characters, narratively uninteresting human characters, and an unfolding mythology that's increasingly less than meets the eye. ",0
105952," Duvall certainly didn't let a small budget intervene with her plan to tell a compelling story, one that's relatable to anyone who has had relationship problems.",1
116926," Mukerji's performance, as previously mentioned, is at the mercy of her character - which alternates between being subject and subplot, according to the whims of a greedy two-pronged biopic.",0
150886," The stars look great, and the Mediterranean looks grand, but I spent more time looking at my watch.",0
26774, This British film is consistently just a little better and more surprising than it first appears.,1
19953," Neither suspenseful nor scary nor action-packed, it's also a poor police procedural.",0
235604," As for the voice talent, Homeland's Mandy Patinkin is the standout, as Papa Smurf -- his warm tones are perfect to play the aged patriarchal figure.",1
138965, [Brad's status] offers satisfaction in White's choice to challenge the audience instead of ingratiating itself to us with a pat happy ending.,1
152720, Captures beautifully the spirit of classic EC Comics.,1
170580, Enough already. A tiresome exercise in pointless celebrity cameos.,0
57376, What should be a moving testament to the enduring friendship between two Chinese women instead plays like a bewildering apologia for co-dependency issues.,0
229030," Ant-Man and The Wasp is bolder, funnier, and far more daring than the film that preceded it, but also slightly less even and narratively tight.",1
157590, A plot that could be written on the back of a pine tree car freshener.,0
60766," [Sánchez] just tries to cram far too much into one film. Ultimately, Marrowbone is an ambitious failure, and that alone almost makes it worth a watch.",0
57460," Roland Emmerich is partial to cutting-edge special effects and stone-age storytelling, meaning that 10,000 B.C., a dim-witted CG extravaganza set in prehistoric times, is something like his ideal project.",0
80369," Landis avoids the heterosexism of Hollywood rom-coms... Easing past sexual confusion, Me Him Her embraces all sexual identities.",1
237128," Each audible breath, each creak, adds a needle stab of anxiety to the story.",1
125559," As an exercise in art, or even polemics, Beyond Rangoon is beyond redemption, but still works its occasional magic with extraordinary flair.",0
119335," Bugsy Malone... but without the bubble guns... Affleck tippy-toes to reach the top shelf where classic movie epics are kept but comes up with only ""Once Upon A Time in Hahvad Yahd."" (Or just maybe, ""The Hatman."")",0
219417," Simply speaking this is a film that deals with good vs. evil, yet it's the grey between the black and white that makes this superhero movie such a provocative and entertaining watch.",1
179365," ""The Possession"" isn't exactly ""The Exorcist,"" but Ole Bornedal's film hits enough high notes to make it a worthwhile addition to the exorcism-film heap, somewhere in the lower middle.",1
95109," One of the best films of the year, and, when it's all said and done, probably the decade.",1
13522," For those who aren't still blindly faithful to something they liked when they were nine, despite the colossal scale, there's little to see here.",0
154840," The Descendants is humane, decent, and close to real quality.",1
181061," We finally get to see the full, destructive power of Skynet. And while it looks great, the story around it sure falls flat.",0
106079, Are we quite sure the Mad Hatter isn't responsible for the screenplay rather than the returning Linda Woolverton?,0
11716," This sharply honed script doesn't mince words, while sticking it to Clooney's corporate hitman. Along with the genius move of hiring real people who've been fired, proving that you don't have to be an actor to dazzle and devastate audiences in a movie.",1
68044," Zwick is attracted to the notions of victory in defeat and the romantic purity of self-sacrifice. His film is, however, a trifle earnest and overlong.",0
138614," It's definitely good, definitely a little bit boring.",0
140068," If Black and White seems facile and inconclusive wading in this end of the pool, it's downright retarded as it skates on the patina of black male virility and racism.",0
214236, Bad Samaritan runs with the theme of class paranoia that also fuelled Eli Roth's recent Death Wish albeit with less logic or panache.,0
68592, What is wrong with these dreary people?,0
191701," The movie is the message, and it's worth seeing.",1
135635," If you've been missing the goofy earnestness of '80s action movies, then we've got good news-they haven't gone away, they simply changed location.",1

164218, Ti West knows how to build suspense with quiet and timing.,1
241022, Probably one of the best blockbusters of the year.,1
204185," The LEGO Movie 2 isn't quite as funny or as brilliantly executed as the original, but it's an ambitious, likable sequel.",1
248822, Exciting to watch but it's far too pale a copy of the prior installment to grip the imagination.,0
164261," It is a more than decent adaptation of the classic tale, one that, despite what I have said in the previous paragraph, never talks down to its audience.",1
217146, Searchig for a concealed subtext seems unnecessary when the story itself is so extraordinary.,1
7488, An interesting subject but a dull film.,0

24894," Gal Gadot's Diana is her best performance to date, blending the kindness, power, and innocence needed for the iconic character.",1
141114," With its off-the-mark proclamations about the Kinks and hi-fi nerd jargon, this feels like a screenplay written by someone who once read about music on Wikipedia but prefers not to listen to it.",0
175538," Like a kid playing make-believe, In America is blithely confident of its own contrivances; it only benefits from a certain unselfconscious naivete.",1

41363," While Kaurismaki's deadpan sense of humor remains, his humanist side feels more prominent than ever before.",1
104529," Artificial, manufactured and devoid of credibility.",0
130706," It has a certain amount of imagination and humor, but it seems as if none of this grew organically; every time the movie allows a home-grown, funny little moment, that information is then gathered up and used later on as a plot device.",0
237198," The Reader is a cloaked male fantasy, in which a milf hides under spinster garb -- all for a 16-year-old's delight.",0
123866, Kabali is the first of his films in a long time that shows off the superstar as a proper actor.,1
191654," Though lumpy and even redundant, Braveheart constantly rebounds on some bold note.",1
191250, It's one of those rarities when too many compliments are not enough and the recommendation to see it as soon as it's near you cannot be stressed enough. ,1
19070, The flaw in the film is that it caters to stereotypes.,0
59054," The movie uses up all its potential funny in its first 10 minutes, and then bounces between tossing up lame, pointless antics with a tenuous connection to the plot, and wimpily shifting the focus of its comeuppance.",0
7881," One of the best scary movies ever made, one of the best scary movies even imaginable.",1
78503," Not only does Birth of the Dragon struggle to correctly handle its main character, Lee is also often positioned as a mere supporting character in an overplayed, overdone romance between McKee and Jingjing Qu's Xiulan.",0
175493," A sparky romp that recalls the children's action movies of the 1980s - The Goonies, The Golden Child or Home Alone - this British-Finnish co-production knows what its audience wants: big bangs, big laughs and adults looking silly.",1
217234, Does little except reinforce the notion that Allen's creative well has long since run dry.,0

237136," Actress-turned-director Elizabeth Banks delivers a comedy that's slightly broader than the first film, and just as infectious.",1
208888," Basically this is the story of some major talents having to make do, once again, with a minor film. And that's a crime too, if not quite a sin.",0
251157, I like this movie a lot.,1
153941, Crowe is a commanding lead actor who could have made it into something special if he'd stayed out of his own way. Maybe he should have stayed home. You should.,0
134512," As with most anthology films, some shorts are stronger than others, but there are definitely a few standouts.",1
75863, The franchise shows that it continues to maintain a good rhythm and chemistry. [Full review in Spanish],1
193485, ...a sort of Cuckoo's-Nest-meets-My-Favorite-Martian that probably sounded good on paper...,0
34757," Paper Heart is a kooky, gentle movie that's all about love, and well worth a look with an open heart.",1
170083," ""Ice Age"" yields to the temptation of conventional animation standards, but it does so with a clean style and authentic humor.",1
131176, Features excellent performances and a plenty discussion-worthy take on personal and marital boundaries--and the way that the same thing looks different from various angles.,1
140715, The best superhero origin story yet to be put on film.,1
165984, A carefully calculated romantic drama that spins out the usual manifestos about the music industry devouring pretty young singers yearning for acceptance.,1
196373, So incredibly wrongheaded and laugh-out-loud funny that it earns enshrinement in the pantheon of cinematic two-headed cows.,0
98742," I Saw the Light may not be the most exciting biopic to hit the screens as of late, but Hiddleston truly nails the troubled singer.",1
80298," If... you [get] the impression that this is all too precious and contrived for a Hollywood film, you're not far from the mark.",0

45589," It's a fantasy, but it summons real emotions.",1
107863," Isn't really as good as the underrated 1980s diptych, Breakin' and the superb Breakin' 2: Electric Boogalo...",0
108828, It's dumb as rocks and thoroughly unnecessary.,0
31838," Considerably helped by the fine supporting cast, who make this mush somewhat palatable.",0
156475," An emotional and interesting drama, raised up by Emma Thompson's nuanced and subtle performance. Though some of the film's commentary is proclaimed so loudly they might as well have used a loud hailer and a giant blackboard.",1
138412, The women in Rough Night are terrific company. They never wear out their welcome. Too bad you can't say the same for the movie.,0
246891, A sequel that lacks the quiet beauty and subtlety of the original!,0
66625," Seeking realism, director Antoine Fuqua conforms the Arthur legend. He makes it boring.",0
190809," With so many vignettes, it's perhaps inevitable that there are the occasional mundane moments. Still, Andersson's distinct way of looking at the world is undeniably unique, wistful, thoughtful and provocative.",0
207904," In short, the failures in storytelling detract from the film, despite its sensitivities, its subtleties and its final payoff of personal sacrifice. ",0
12772," While the final hour or so of the film is depressing beyond belief, the middle section does grab attention, with Diaz creating some truly memorable moments amid the rambling narrative.",0
28904, It may be true that the character of a person may be more or less set by the time they are seven. But there's no predicting exactly where that character will lead.,1
234387, The good thing -- the only good thing -- about Extreme Ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to-do list.,0

119671, ...a tremendously disappointing missed opportunity and yet another subpar effort from a once-vital filmmaker. ,0
112222," Sidney Hayers shoots the whole thing with an almost Wellesian flourish, and the script (by Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson) is structured with incredible tightness.",1
304," Director Jamie Travis is content to keep FOR A GOOD TIME, CALL... at a sitcom level, set in a squeaky-clean, good-natured New York. ",0
57935, Dead Man is surprisingly bland. And it becomes more dull -- and more grotesque -- as it moves along.,0
42093," Formulaic, obvious and very slow!",0
138656," Gentle and autumnal, 'Mr. Holmes' will undoubtedly strike younger viewers as overly decorous, but it's a perfect antidote to the loud, vulgar bastardizations of the character starring Robert Downey, Jr.",1
77861," Nearly a half century after The Lord of the Rings was published, film technology finally caught up to bring the magic to the screen.",1

117076," Hits the sweet spot between stunning ineptitude, hilariously dated period touchstones, and a touching naïveté that gives it an odd distinction.",1
215702," Admirably restrained, this is nonetheless a historical drama on an expansive canvas that, even though it runs over three hours, is always engaging.",1
37599, Whether or not this is the best film Marvel Studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking. ,1
121407, Frustratingly average and feels like only a slightly better than normal addition to the franchise despite luring Jamie Lee Curtis back,0
149113," When even David Fincher can't make a compelling, innovative Zodiac Killer film, it's time to hang up the old ciphers.",0
243128, Cattet and Forzani are in an exciting but maddening class of filmmakers: they are deft with camerawork and mood but they barrage the viewer with symbols and keys without any space to connect anything.,0
189368," Probably the best-known but-I-digress novel in English literature, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, has inspired Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story, surely the best but-I-digress movie this side of Adaptation.",1
172767," The rudeness isn't particularly creative and the repeated horror movie jokes wear thin before long, leaving viewers checking their watches and wondering if they can't pick up the pace and bump off a few more victims a bit more quickly.",0
186028," A lovely, glacially told gem from animator Isao Takahata, the 78-year-old cofounder with Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli.",1
155961, The most important part of the movie is that it can be funny without being snobby.,1
229862," It's scary and often graphic, but as the action escalates to the point of absurdity, the spirit of early Sam Raimi starts to creep into both the action and the dialogue.",1
137299," They might have just got away with it as a Sunday night mini-series but from a cinematic perspective, this trip shouldn't have been embarked upon.",0
245466," A gentle, Chekhovian-style drama of family conflict in Japan's leading harbor city of Yokohama.",1

49267, The film is usually transparent in its unbridled and excessive adulation of Al Gore.,0
51112, A humorous and touching tale about unexpected friendship.,1
78144," It's 'Saw' meets 'Sherlock Holmes.' """,1
160384," Mostly it strips away the qualities that made the original such a gem, starting with the bruised soul that compels these retirees to gamble away their remaining years.",0
193124," A caricatured D and his antics, coupled with bad sound designing, make Coffee With D end nowhere close to a fun film it could have been.",0
207108, Disney has shown good taste by releasing a full-length animated feature without songs.,1
38050," Talley's accomplishments are many, but like the man himself, the movie doesn't veer into hyperbole and aggrandizement. In keeping with its subject, it keeps things quietly honest. ",1

175709, Quaint and refreshing!,1
135013," This is melodrama, after all, but borderline boring melodrama, painting over scenes of potentially high tension with blasé realism.",0
96797," Von Trier seems content to broach ideas rather than explore them and, consequently, his movie is technically accomplished and teasing rather than intellectually provocative.",1

90911, That Martin Scorsese's brilliant GoodFellas lost the 1990 Best Picture and Best Director Oscars to Dances with Wolves is one of the all-time miscarriages of justice in the history of the Academy Awards.,1

119740," Like the Evil Dead remake, this film is respectful to the original and offers something a bit different as well.",1

37538, The music in Trolls is programmed by your local karaoke bar and sung like everyone's getting paid REALLY WELL.,0

243634," A family-friendly, energetic surprise that injects fresh new life into the abysmal franchise.",1
20794," I miss the days when big-budget movies actually delivered on memorable thrills and characters. Prince of Persia has neither, only a lazy script enhanced by computer-generated visuals.",0
199115," Daring though it is, it follows the same trajectory as the wounded plane aboard which the film is set. That is, it circles and circles but never really goes anywhere.",0
101392," Never really hits or finds its footing, making it a decent and at times inspiring film, but one that leaves you wanting to dive more fully into either Carr or Ginsberg's lives.",0

53617," Rich with ideas, and driven by extraordinary visuals, the occasionally confusing but deeply rewarding 'Oblivion' is a top-flight slice of sci-fi.",1
246765," The point of this vile, cynical and ultimately preposterous film is that America is reeling from spiritual numbness and ethical paralysis, and optimism is a game for fools.",0
61906," While many of the characters are getting satisfactorily high, audiences are unfortunately left with a movie that's only half-baked.",0
155462," The acting by a mostly amateur cast is over the top, the writing is genuinely ludicrous, and the characters so contrived that the movie defies even the most basic logic.",0

139336, I was grasping at straws to find anyone in the film that acted like a normal human being with a moral center.,0
117312, [Widows has] enough stylistic flourish and character nuances to keep the audience engaged and entertain them through the familiar parts.,1

46937," A long, boring, meandering, dog of a movie.",0
234790," There are moments of true terror and a fair dollop of tension, but it quickly became clear that Green may be boxing far above his weight.",1
83696, The Coens explode onto the scene with this blistering neo-noir masterpiece.,1
105753," Borrowing from too many movies to count, Rocket Science botches that brew in an unwieldy slew of adolescent-angst clichés.",0
48933, Embellishing Jack Abramoff's story with so much humor makes the film feel more like a political parody than a document of what really happened.,0
108085," Moviegoers beware: nausea is a prime side effect of consuming Feast of Love, an extraordinarily inane multi-character saga about the complexities of love from Robert Benton",0
125231," Although this infamous crime caper has a terrific cast, it's uneven and forgettable,",0
209039, Thrilling third Indy actioner focuses on hunt for grail.,1
249178," Visually, the picture is all of a piece, but it's a self-conscious piece of work -- all dark-toned academic classicism.",0
218027," Saw dances close to the edge of cliche, but doesn't fall into the pit too often. It sets up some excellent red herrings, and I was satisfied with the ending.",1
132796," Timing is everything and, in this case, the moral repercussions of this drug-crazed sci-fi-er ring are especially reprehensible.",0
54046," For a movie seemingly concerned with clarity and enlightenment, it's woefully lacking in both.",0
87096," Not what you'd call crowd-pleasing, this is fascinating - if occasionally harrowing - in its realistic depiction of the intricacies of CIA operations.",1

201401, Requiem for a Dream may be the first movie to fully capture the way that drugs dislocate us from ourselves.,1
156293, Messy movie. Not much for teens here.,0
25893," ""Pain & Gain"" brings the pain, but it's difficult to see the gain.",0
149549," I can't say if this nicely crafted nonsense will sell as a franchise, but I know that I miss the unpretentiousness of the Bourne movies.",0
194257," It's both a ""true crime"" movie and a poetic account of two young men who, by committing an act of unspeakable brutality, unleash the furies against themselves.",1
147338," A rip-roaring, high-spirited American adventure, it's one of the best scavenger hunts to come along in ages!",1
88129," Happy Death Day 2U wants to be the breath of fresh air the original was. Unfortunately, it probably only ever had the potential to be a handsome bit of déjà vu.",0
85964," As a movie, Transformers is mostly muscle car, but it has enough of a brain under its hood to know how, and when, to be funny.",1
180071," This movie fails to hook early on, so you resist being taken where it wants to go, no matter how intriguing that destination may be.",0
178892," It is more than just a hostage-crisis film. It tries hard to make you think about the bigger picture, and mostly succeeds.",1
5866," Altman's film is less a satisfaction of narrative rhythms and archetypes than a story half-remembered, buried in time, in opiate indifference, that's all the more melancholy for its diffusion.",1
159367, P.T. Barnum and H.L. Mencken remain inarguably correct in their assessment of the public's gullibility and appetite.,0
170359," With a man-against-the-elements adventure like this one, the emphasis is, and should be, largely on spectacular depiction of the environment, and [the] directors...make use of the biggest budget yet afforded to a Norwegian film... [Blu-ray]",1
27970," The monster battles have enough wow to keep the movie rolling along, but the connective tissue is so thin that it scarcely matters who lives and who gets stomped, eaten, blown up, ripped to shreds or impaled.",0
167639," This is a sharp hook for a motion picture, provided the movie manages to rise above the level of merely coming across as a didactic rant.",0
104476, the rotund baseball cap wearing 'everyman' filmmaker adds a grand sequel to his resume,1
134107, It's both endearing and hard to watch because it constantly confronts death... But there's a warmth and emotion breathed into each frame. [Full Review in Spanish] ,1
93818," A light, fun side adventure that has a lot more fun with the premise and universe of Ant-Man...",1
67994," There's something alluringly, disconcertingly off-kilter from the get-go in Ain't Them Bodies Saints.",1
33421," As the roof burns, as the administration's dishonesty is becoming a subject even for mainstream media coverage, more questions must circulate.",1
246111," [F]ails to get to deeper ideas and truths that are ripe for exploration in precisely a film of this nature, and it winds up almost a caricature of the very sort of film it tries to emulate.",0
119179," [Pike is] a star presence here from her very first scene; it's even rewarding, given her expressive voice, to hear her reading from Amy's diary entries.",1
7458," Some movies were made for the big screen, some for the small screen, and some, like Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, were made for the palm screen.",0
172706," Against all reason and expectation, the result is a distinctly unfunny film.",0
188473," The tension of life-and-death situations and of egos that need to cooperate to survive, is manifest in 'The Hurt Locker.'",1
178302, a frothy romp of a popcorn flick brightened by witty writing and a cast that get laughs by expertly playing it straight with a plausibly implausible plot. ,1
40120," Despite [its] stacked deck of a cast, ""Runner Runner"" adds up to little more than a charmless, paint-by-numbers thriller ...",0
118387, There is a quality to these performances and an earnestness to the filmmaking that's more than enough to recommend.,1
71755," The acting impresses, the plight of the characters, less rounded and sympathetic than they are in the book, merely depresses. Roadworthy then, but hardly revolutionary.",1
2264, Fails to elicit memorable work from any of its principal collaborators.,0
189791," Moving, mesmerising and genuinely from the heart, the extraordinary new Australian documentary holds a mirror to the unique life and music of the late indigenous singer-songwriter Gurrumul Yunupingu.",1
79901, Hector and the Search for Happiness includes laughs and relatable drama but struggles to find balance between engaging journeys and thought-provoking destinations.,1
15284," One can only imagine that, given that there's little gore or sex, the restricted entry level is designed to protect younger viewers from the deeply upsetting feelings of frustration and irritation that emerge once it becomes clear that nothing is working.",0
236198," When added altogether, Horrible Bosses gets the job done but is not recommended for advancement.",0
187566, People watching birds is a nice thing. People watching a movie about people watching birds is sort of a snore.,0
111437," Visually, narratively, every creative choice forks off down the most obvious route.",0
184635," While the film suffers from a forced absurdity meant to invoke comedy and laughs along with a sluggish pacing, Rejtman captures the grim monotony of life well.",1
230154, The Children of Huang Shi is an engaging story and the film is beautiful to look at.,1
180451," From the opening scenes prior to the sparkling credits to the final de(construct)evolution scene, the crew and cast have made a film that will be talked about this summer, in future film/ethnography classes and at the upcoming awards season. ",1
21328," Thank goodness for Fey, who lends this sitcom soap a credible emotional center.",1
103087," A dark and stirring variation on the standard coming-of-age narrative that, much like its central characters, does not follow the path one might expect.",1
244933, This is what movies can be like if you try. ,1
245537," This second live-action film [is] a blend of kinetic violence, bizarre aliens and actors the calibre of Laura Linney wondering what on earth they've got themselves into.",0

215782," The whole thing is cheerfully engaging, thanks to inspired direction by Luke Greenfield.",1
23905, Don't believe the backlash. This is one dark and disturbing horror flick.,1
209395," Leading man Sam Worthington exacerbates the film's downbeat tone: as Perseus, Worthington remains a credible but basically charisma-free actor.",0
195158," Script-wise, there is nothing truly revelatory here, but the patient viewer will be rewarded by a film of unique awe and heart wrenching wonder. ",1
204359," Overall, the film lacks that precise hook of exactly why it's worth telling this story now, but it remains a fascinating story nonetheless.",1
234546, Disturbing in that it feels so damn real. ,1
206027, Joan Crawford gives one of her most iconic (Oscar-winning) performances in Michael Curtiz's quintessential film noir and woman's picture of the 1940s.,1
145049," ...there eventually does reach a point at which Scott's performance, ingratiating as it is, simply proves unable to compensate for the film's myriad of deficiencies.",0
101356," There are times in Pan when you are left in awe of what you are seeing, with some remarkable visuals, and the occasional scene that will have you completely mesmerised. But regrettably such moments are few and far between.",0
90867," Weiner entertains us with a political train wreck in the making. You can't look away even as it comes up short on the tough questions, such as ""Why?""",1
184555," Saw II feels like an episode of Fear Factor or Big Brother with Rob Zombie at the helm, and if that doesn't scare you away from this ridiculous movie, well, feel free to indulge your questionable tastes.",0
164297," Waiting for 'Superman' isn't just a well-made, persuasive documentary. It's a turning point. At least you come out of the theater hoping so. ",1
138382," The characters' skin looks like hard plastic, so it's as if a bunch of GI Joes are trying to escape the plague of locusts, and all of the human characters appear to be lit from within, like nightlights.",0
189172," A treat for Hitchcock fans and cineastes, this is absolutely a primer for any and all budding filmmakers and should send people rushing out to get a book that's still in print and still arguably the most indispensible tome on movies ever written.",1
75216," Balaguero and Plaza's sequel is derivative to a fault, but when it comes to the masterful handling of tension and terror, the devil is all in the detail.",1
70945," Assayas has mapped out potentially interesting contrasts here - two worlds colliding, the spiritual and the material. It's a good idea, but not much seems to arise from the way these two realms come into conflict.",0
205949," Handsome, charismatic and funny, Smith gives the film a likability it would otherwise lack.",1
13840, It's as flawless a horror film -- and specifically a monster movie -- you're likely to find in this or any other year.,1

239303," The result is a slow-acting poison pill of a movie, brutal and effective.",1
235810," You don't need buckets of moolah and a zillion computer-generated effects to get a rise out of an audience. Just a little imagination, a little suggestive terror, will do quite nicely.",1

80569, Julie Andrews would be proud of Emily Blunt's impeccable portrayal.,1

76211," The dialogue, which is read with either insufficient or excessive emphasis by the nonactors, is often buried under a soundtrack of vintage blues, making it doubly hard to follow. Even the slaughter of the sheep is numbingly uneventful.",0
152787, Mainly this ridiculous thing lurches from genre to genre without director Seth Gordon ever establishing a credible threat.,0
128506, Mortal Engines is pathologically wedded to its steampunk aesthetic. Often it feels like being battered half to death with a copy of Cherie Priest's Boneshaker.,0
153766," This is a delightful movie, funny, absurd, anarchic and profound. ",1
54481," Ultimately, if you want to choke on a narrative that is rife with clichés and devoid of any real moral message then stick After The Ball on, if not, there are surely more productive things you can do... Such as watching paint dry.",0

216122," ""Man of Steel"" is an exciting film that every super hero fan will love.",1
241677," The Lazarus Effect doesn't exactly break new ground, but it nonetheless finds plenty to relish in the mouldering bits it stitches together as it gives classic themes about death, life and the soul a literal and figurative shot in the arm.",1

44794," Outside of a few action sequences, ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is boring. ",0

2424," [The Shadowhunters are] a bunch of half-angelic beings tasked with fighting demons and watching over the ""mundanes,"" which I swear is actually what they call humans, I guess because ""boring poo-poo stupidheads"" might be a touch on the nose.",0
51713," Minions is a fun backstory for a popular group of sidekicks, but it really shouldn't extend beyond that. It does a good job with what it has, but it won't leave you asking for more.",1

165443," Scorsese, that artist of headlong temperament, here exhibits enormous patience.",1
147626," ""Carnage Park"" is a solid, unsparing thriller, but its potential for greatness slips just out of grasp during its climactic stretch.",1
127194," This fresh and rebellious quasi rom-com liberates the glamorous Olivia Wilde from the shackles of two-dimensional studio fare, reinventing her as a laidback tomboy involved in a romantic quadrangle.",1
140827," There's an improvisatory air, overlaid with quirky charm but never any bite. Hoffman's performance needs tougher, more focused direction.",0
54475," It is at once a celebration of a genre-busting writer/rabble-rouser, and an elegy for a time period when a freak like Thompson could get access to political leaders and actually affect some kind of radical change.",1
80966," The film has action and lots of loud gunplay, but Audiard's direction tends to tease out the story's quieter moments, favoring characterization and dialogue. ",1

227665," The details of what went down are fascinating, but the ultimate focus of Best of Enemies is television and this demonstration that it can be both eminently viewable and illuminating.",1
125292," An incredible story, and Holmes keeps a sharp eye on its cultural commentary to make it a part of a contemporary conversation.",1
120845," While Sfar doesn't dare tinker with the facts or sully the mystique, he gains enormous traction via the imaginative and subversive manner he has devised to tell a story that, in many ways, is hard to believe.",1
138926," Two men played by Steve Carell and Bryan Cranston deliver soul-searching performance, telling off the Marines who insist on buying a dead soldier where they want to bury him.",1
164416, Milo and Otis by way of The Birds by way of I Spit On Your Grave.,1
105707," Slowly, the powerful message of heart and soul winning out over an impaired body and over-thinking mind develops into the core drama of this otherwise modest doc.",1
99640, The movie builds with a tragic eloquence that's haunting while at the same time delivering a justifiably tear-filled coda that had me smiling in hopeful exuberance.,1

225009," Deep down beats the heart of a great horror movie, but it's lost in cheap jump scares, bad CGI, and heavy cribbing from ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""The Ring.""",0
131592," Although it meanders at points, there is a very welcome sense that Allen is back on track.",1
115077, You know what would be revolutionary? Making a really good movie about a three-dimensional teenage female character that doesn't start and finish with both eyes on the same old punishing character types.,0
218933, Airheaded but fun.,1
91775," Neither character seems especially sympathetic (that's the point of Dubus's first-person narrations), only flawed and human, but Perelman's miscasting makes sure they come off as glamorized stereotypes.",0
22964," Adam McKay once again shows that he has a lot to say about his country, and that he says it by using his obvious talents as a comedy director. [Full review in Spanish]",1
166884," So sure, the characters and jokes may feel awfully familiar, but for those who see a little of themselves in Angelo's family, well, that's just part of this little movie's charm.",1
45392," Noirish touches flesh out the wispy plot, yet it's the old-school animation that engages most: lending clarity to the emotions at stake, ensuring our sickly hero's resilience tugs on the heart.",1
147377," For its examination of the crime and the language surrounding it, and for illuminating an entire town's truly ingrained misogyny, it is unforgettable.",1
13508, One of the year's best movies.,1
172615," Most depressingly of all there is Robert de Niro, playing a sick old guy in hospital who wants to see the ball drop one more time. I would like to see it drop on Garry Marshall's head.",0
178059," It's an ambitious hybrid, grafting the ethereal, landscape-driven, light-infused beauty and naïf narration associated with Terrence Malick onto a tale in which struggle against supernatural forces is just one challenge of coming of age.",1
106454," If you've been to Lake Tahoe, you know that people like this are in great abundance. You also know that you probably wouldn't want to watch a movie about their petty squabbles. Trust your gut.",0
5836," Bears many of the same fatalistic concerns as its 1957 predecessor, but its totally slick execution... polishes the feeling right out of them.",0
149844," This is quite a dense film in terms of character; there's a lot to get your teeth into and, at the end of it all, it's a rattling good story. ",1
24643, McTiernan does a great job with this submarine thriller. Also features a stellar ensemble of character actors.,1
87456," Fuqua expertly cranks up the tension, while conveniently overlooking any pesky moral issues that McCall's behaviour raises. It's about as subtle as a bulldozer.",1
135447," The Muppet charm, always more at home within the intimate frame of a TV set, is gone here.",0
197734," Unlike the cloying contrivances of It's Complicated, Hope Springs is audacious in its commitment to subtle authenticity, never artificially upping the dramatic stakes but instead staying true to its small yet relatable story.",1
237247," It is the style, stupid- the dialogue, the gloominess, the shadows, the doomed destiny that prevails over everything. This is right in line with these noir ideals, but tells the story with bravura and a technical prowess not available in the 1940s.",1
155441," Scoop represents a significant step backward. The longer the movie goes on, the more we feel as if we're watching a balloon deflate.",0
192486," While far from terrible, this retread forgoes any qualities to justify its existence in the first place. It will be justly forgotten before long.",0
100693," Whenever you can set aside a few hours for this thing, go and see it. Just be prepared for it: this ain't a movie you can just casually watch.",1
22240," Yet, like so many big-budget movies these days, it's hard to care much about what's going on, especially as the film builds to its special-effects-driven conclusion.",0
178869, It's bloody good fun.,1
108751," It has everything you'd really want in a popcorn movie: humor, action, romance, and a really hot redhead!!!",1
241743," However, as intriguing as this interpretation is, it fails dramatically.",0
186755," Funny People is genuinely funny at times, predictably foul-mouthed, touching and surprisingly frank in its approach to death, love and loyalty.",1
107209," It's a good thing that [the] characters genuinely care about each other, because Proud Mary sure doesn't, and most of the people watching it won't either.",0
251258, When John Carter moves up the gears it's an accomplished blockbuster packed with pulse-racing action.,1
53670, Second-rate and ordinary.,0
73332," Directed and co-written by Herzog (with Herbert Golder) and executive produced by Lynch,[the film] offers a whiff of originality in a sea of cinema schlock. But compared to both filmmakers' prior works, it's nowhere near as memorable.",0
134426, What Lowery's remake does best is convey classic Disney magic in a family film that's as uplifting for kids as it is for adults.,1
174452," Wrenching, mature drama is a showcase for Julianne Moore.",1
78627," Sienna Miller, revealing a depth and presence she's never hinted at before, inhabits Sedgwick with raw exuberance.",1
57744," Frustrating but sincere and well acted, especially by Tucci, who embodies a middle-aged man in transition, ""Submission"" explores well the risk associated with stepping out of one's comfort zone and shaking free from the stranglehold of mediocrity.",1
8442," While better than it should be, if you listen hard enough you can actually hear a barrel being scraped between the gags.",1
151793," A busy but witless and stale comedy that rehashes every raunchy gag we expect from R-rated comedies, it also wears its hackneyed sentimentality and cookie-cutter underdog story beats as proudly as adhesive nametags.",0
169716," Urban Legends: Final Cut will not win the story's coveted Hitchcock award, since all the scares are made up of sudden surprises without suspense, and there's nothing special about the production quality, either.",0
2954," Brilliant teen pregnancy comedy is funny, moving.",1
169789, This is one of those films that isn't nearly as interesting as the conversations that it may inspire.,0
203804," Given Waititi's creativity, I was a little disappointed in how few surprises there are in Wilderpeople. But it's all right to be just a well-executed charmer -- and this movie is certainly that.",1
162901," An admirably innovative approach, it does indeed create a sense of helpless frustration, but as Julia's Eyes continues, the technique feels less creepy than contrived.",0
205196," Stigmata is a beautiful disaster: deeply felt and faux-profound at once and, like all great Theater of the Absurd, able to highlight the extra-textual consequence of that tension.",1
232874, A predictable Cinderella story in the Pretty Woman /Working Girl mold that is undone by a preposterous plot and its stars' complete lack of chemistry.,0
220022," Fey may get top billing for ""Baby Mama,"" and deservedly so, but it's Poehler who actually ends up providing the most laughs.",1
63538, [It] never feels clinical - Von Trier's poetic cinematography and death metal theme song are too forceful for that - but it does live somewhere on the edge of therapy.,1

238390," We root for Frank even though his antics as the Crimson Bolt become more and more extreme as the film goes along, especially after Boltie joins the team, keeping things in an insane moralistic grey area that's thought-provoking and invigorating.",1
79206," With the sun-dappled images and the lush forest setting, Lowery aims for a sense of wonder and majesty, but his story never really gets off the ground.",0
73716," If you're not up on history, religion and crazy conspiracy theories, it's easy to feel a little lost.",0
186015," The film's narrow view, established early on, rarely transcends its gimmicky concept. ",0
214143," If you're the sort who can enjoy an old-fashioned ghost story without speeding right to the 'good parts,' The Fog is a highly recommended little shocker.",1

232533," If I hear someone say ""Old sport"" one more time I will run them over with my giant yellow convertible.",0
151189, The action sequences are so slow to the point it becomes boring. A sin for the genre. [Full review in Spanish],0
112302, Action comes easy to Korean director Kim; it's actors that he doesn't always know what to do with.,0
131139, Gives you more reason than ever to love Black's death scene in 1997's The Jackal.,0
111919," Craig Brewer's adaptation cleverly gives several nods and winks to the first film, but also has a modern sensibility that every teenager today will understand. ",1
3294, This return to the past feels more lazy than liberating.,0
161266, This is a movie custom made for people who became outraged when Starbucks made their Christmas coffee cups red.,0
24420," The black-and-white visuals disturb for only so long, and while themes of indoctrination and conspiracy prove initially intriguing, the film quickly descends into fistfights and gunfire.",0
135584," In the last chapter of this overhyped saga, the plot drags too much and rushes to solve all the loose ends. [Full review in Spanish]",0
41350," It's a hard film to like, but it's even harder to dismiss, simply because it's never less than absolutely fascinating.",1
151502," While Donnie Darko is a fine film regardless of your level of sobriety, Richard Kelly's sophomore effort most definitely is not.",0
245425," The gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel/remake uses every trick in the cinematic book, and confirms that Bruce Campbell and Raimi are gods.",1
133953," Jupiter Ascending vibrates like an episode of Star Wars retold by a teenager on Red Bull, a cacophony of nonsense that peaks with poor Sean Bean telling us that ""bees are genetically designed to recognise royalty"".",0
160973, The isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor.,0
110517," Despite oblique references to Psycho and Children of the Corn, Freddy vs. Jason lacks the knowing wit needed to keep it afloat in an age when even the horror spoofs have been spoofed.",0

197889," Clunky, tin-eared caper comedy that drips with contempt for its own characters. ",0
226743," There's lots of fun to be had here, much whimsy and fun grounded by the serious issues of the time. Ultimately Hail Caesar is a bouncy satire with a heart of gold to brighten February's pall.",1
70059," It stirs a stew of genre conventions, from political commentary to dysfunctional family satire to earnest emotional pathos, into an often thrilling monster movie as indebted to the B-movies of seventies American drive-ins as it is to Japan's Godzilla",1
213760, Jean Cocteau's scripting and directing give the film its proper key of unworldliness.,1
28689," Well, the best movie of 2009 is a documentary about aging heavy metal musicians making a last-ditch effort at fame and fortune.",1
213368," What it does offer are some wildly colourful, jaw-dropping anecdotes from their friends and collaborators about their working methods.",1
40350," The combination of emotional impact and brutal imagery is initially potent, but the second half of the movie wallows in occult cheese that's hard to swallow.",0
202401, The aesthetic accomplishments of the movie can't make up for the lack of a compelling narrative.,0
174487, There is a mournful tone to a film that records testimony from individuals in Britain and America living with the consequences of disadvantage.,1
203397," Like the longest BMW featurette Guy Ritchie never made, this action yarn is a slick, sexy little package with fast cars, big explosions, dazzling locations in the south of France, a trip-hop score, and about as much plot to fill a thimble.",0
95712, The movie lacks style and pacing; Franco and Myles look too contemporary. They would be more at home with their romantic problems on some Fox or WB drama ...,0
113854," Wish Upon is a mess from initial premise, let alone its direction and editing - not even Hitchcock himself could've saved this one.",0
142478, Jarecki offers 100 small conclusions rather than one big one for you to take away.,1
69194, An extremely confident and undeniably well-made Vietnam war movie...,1

215022," Dagg keeps things simple, but his jogging camera whips up the urgency and he's well-served by Sutherland's rangy physicality.",1
214572, Attempts to capture the appeal of a classical Victorian romance - tragedy and all - but has neither the complexity nor the historical context necessary to live up to its ambition.,0
194777," Bitterly cynical, redundantly evoking regret and acceptance.",0
30854," Graceless and woefully inspired, adding another bomb to Spade's cratered filmography, also triggering a distinct desire to never see another Tyler Spindel picture.",0
243375, Anyone not already familiar with his work will learn virtually nothing about one of jazz's most important figures.,0
214675," Salva may not be doing anything new, but he does it well enough to suggest it won't be 23 more years before the Creeper shows up again.",1
197207," Ultimately, this documentary serves as another positive example of the cultural phenomenon that is Grace Jones.",1
46786," The wordplay zips back and forth, never stooping to smarmy innuendo. It's the kind of clever that parents will enjoy as their little ones focus on the brightly colored, energetic ""foodimals,"" friends they'd never think of devouring.",1
240940, Home Again is comedy in the comfort zone. Rather than cite all the things this movie doesn't have-I'd rather compliment Meyers-Shyer old-fashioned Hollywood movie that chooses to swim against the tide of the moment,1

121452, The A-Team is full of summer popcorn action movie goodness. That's all it aspires to be and in that it succeeds for the most part.,1
161160," Demolition could easily be maudlin, some urban Nicholas Sparks-type weeper in which ideas run out before tissues. But this is Vallée, whose dexterity with downbeat material is edgier... daring the audience to cry at tragedy, rather than expecting it.",1
117661, Dear Ex has good performances and a story that should be relatable to anyone who has gone through family problems as a kid.,1
251190," This film's harshness and starkness will strike some people as vulgar, but if you reject it on that basis you might as well just reject the times you're living in.",1

158983, The film's various problems ultimately and collectively undermine its overall effectiveness and the touching tale it's trying to tell.,0
99234," Every aspect of the film seeks to make an emotional connection with the audience via specificity, and thanks to masterful work from Lonergan as writer and director and phenomenal performances from the entire ensemble cast, it is an absolute triumph.",1
200027," Brilliantly filmed by writer-director Milcho Manchevski in the rugged hills of Macedonia and the gray streets of London, this three-part tale proves a revelation, spellbindingly told and disturbingly contemporary.",1

144436," Murray does his best to hold up the movie, but there's only so much he can do. Ultimately, his latest fish out of water never makes it back upstream.",0
189145, Alice in Wonderland is one of those tragic movies whose frame story is actually more interesting than the story itself.,0
142873," Simmons's talents carry the film, elevating the work of his fellow actors.",1

113184," Jaws meets Lifeboat, with an assist from Herman Melville.",1
47004," For pure filmmaking - characters taking up half the foreground in close-up while events unfold behind them, action speeding up or stopping on command, a soundtrack of classic rock remixed or redone into droning trances - it's remarkable.",1
17322," Influenced by Jacques Tati, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton -- as well as the British Carry On slapstick farces -- this film has long stretches without any dialogue at all.",1
178354," For all its faults, there is a kind of genius in the way that it takes the rom-com raison d'etre - the desire to see two lovable people fall in love with each other - and diverts it for its own purposes.",1

160305," ""Higher Ground"" glides and takes time to explore. In the best way it feels very '70s: It's about a relatable lost soul finding herself.",1
16280, self-serving hyper-idealized drivel,0
102101," I'm grateful that Hollywood has realized that female audiences are among comedy fans and are under-served, that doesn't mean they should be forced to settle for garbage",0
156875," It's extreme for its own sake, and too rarely for the satirical purposes of Baron Cohen's better vehicles, ""Borat"" and ""Bruno.""",0

32056," The last M:I film, 2011's Ghost Protocol, remains the series' high point because it was so consistently engaging. This time, we spend much too long in government back rooms discussing politics.",0

71674," One of the year's best films, Trumbo is alternately poignant, amusing, infuriating and always thought-provoking. It's also a potent wake-up call for anyone not too lethargic to heed its alarm.",1
5601," An incredible infusion of modernity and Restoration-era Great Britain-a boisterous, farcical, and unapologetically inexplicable update on the royal British period piece.",1
243541," Even with the bonus incentive of a portion of the proceeds going to charity, this last-minute cash-grab fails to justify its existence.",0

125393," With some of the best battle scenes since Peter Jackson's The Two Towers, a smattering of 1980s love scenes and all the far eastern promise of a Twinings advert, you can't really beat Red Cliff as the classiest and most fabulous blockbuster of the summer.",1

205478," Tea With the Dames peters out as a conversation, given there's no real beginning, middle or end to the film. It's a privilege, however, to have been given a tableside seat to listen to this foursome reminisce and ruminate for an hour and a half.",1

37486," The new film keeps about 90% of the original story and even some of the original lines of dialogue, yet the changes it makes are all misguided.",0
41779, Fails to improve on the original film thanks to a poorly paced middle section and an annoying tendency towards over-explaining things.,0
112396, It is a real pity that the intelligence of its first scenes and even its first half hour aren't sustained through the whole film. [Full review in Spanish],0
151153," It's a rather fascinating bit of artistic self-indulgence that's both made by, and about, self-indulgent men, although one that can certainly grow taxing.",1
47663," If you ever wondered what a live-action Hayao Miyazaki film would look like, Avatar is a damn good approximation.",1

108337, This is what a romantic comedy looks like when it's being built on scar tissue.,1
127348," Shults can't quite help himself from over-directing every moment. He's seemingly lived this subject matter, even casting himself as Krisha's long tormented son. But being this close to the material has swayed his film into the realm of misery porn.",0
80150," There's not much new for Farley fans, but they'll enjoy the admiring and amiable tribute.",1

29880," Coco Before Chanel's approach is classic arthouse: handsome, measured, respectful, and soul-crushingly bland",0

49238," Just when you think things can't stoop any lower, Owen Wilson performs acrobatics in blue lycra.",0
61884," Everyone wanted to see the future, but I knew that would just be big robot fights. Cool maybe, but that's a war movie, not a character investment suspenseful action movie. So here, this is what you wanted. Happy now?",0

51515," American Pie shows us how little boys know about sex going into it, and how little the act really teaches them about it as well. But the true joy, for us in the audience anyway, is the chase. Vulgar and heartwarming!",1
10982, The screengrab gimmick is smarter than the mundane pattern of screaming teens and gory deaths set up by the premise.,0
111293," It's a comedy without laughs, a satire that takes two hours to make a two minute point; if you're reading this online, it's already too late.",0
36150," This could have been a crackerjack paranoid thriller of the Fritz Lang school, but director Terry George is more interested in making a prestige picture, full of yelling and crying.",0
31968, Has a false ring.,0

84962," For a movie proselytizing the dire need to preserve our rivers and oceans, 'Watermark' is shockingly dry.",0
82198," Vilhunen explores real hardships of the working-class, and her portrayal of teens is heartbreakingly authentic. Honkonen and Ristseppä give sensitive performances that will haunt you after the final scene.",1
189523, The idea seems to be to try and make the experience of the 12 Polish Jews who hid in a sewer for 14 months as uncomfortable for the audience as it was for them.,0

230718, Exquisite performances drive this sharply observed examination of artistic integrity and a crumbling marriage.,1

164989," An exquisite celebration of language, life and love.",1
147985," Helped along by a gloomy, oppressive score, it neither thoughtfully examines themes of trauma, guilt and grief nor moves with any sort of haste to its eventual, obvious, revenge-thriller conclusion, despite its short 90-minute running time.",0
92633," Is there enough here to keep us interested? Yes, but there's a frustrating sense of time being marked in much of ""Part 1"" and the script often veers into no-duh territory.",1
225339, A wonderfully gorgeous and nostalgic film whose story doesn't live up to its look. ,1
238492," With each addition to the Twilight series, it becomes clearer that one movie condensing all four Stephenie Meyers books would be the most painless way to tell this repetitive story. Kind of like snatching off a Band-Aid, rather than tugging it slowly.",0

163533," Day-Lewis, over-egging the angst as well as the Eye-talian accent, is charmless and insufferable. But the person you really want to slap is Marshall, whose brash directing style simply doesn't suit Nine's more whimsical charms.",0
61810, Slow pacing on top of subdued performances and a misappropriation of the film's focus turns us into the real victims of this film.,0
107160," It's not Van Sant's most tightly crafted story, but it's a compassionate saga of the Sisyphean task of sobriety.",1
203633," As the bodies pile up in the second half, along with the switchback narrative reveals, ""The Hateful Eight"" becomes a hermetically sealed exercise of a dispiriting sort.",0
248461," Any work that purports to be about the nature of the soul is pretty high in the pretension realm. In this case, it's also one of the most fascinating movies of 2009.",1
42088," Throw in some John Williams' music from ""Midway"" and we've got Bay as Spielucasron.",0
28793, It's nothing but enjoyable to watch in a minor key.,1
4671," What sets the film apart from other examples of Exploding Cinema is a combination of tone, inventiveness, cheekiness -- and Jason Statham.",1
154049," People say the movie musical is dead. Tell that that to your tapping toes while watching the enchantment of La La Land, one of the year's best films.",1
33042," A rewarding experience, even if it fails to completely sweep you off your feet. ",1
140553," While the notion that the power of the common man shouldn't be underestimated is noble in Jai Ho, I wish its makers had also remembered not to underestimate their common sense.",0
162738, Former child star Saoirse Ronan - the girl in Joe Wright's masterful 2007 film Atonement - shines.,1
242552," The director, rather than depicting his village, not only shows his country, but the society in which many of us live around the world. [Full review in Spanish]",1
79154," Just like the Queen, while ""Mirror Mirror"" looks good on the outside ... it's rotting from within. We are far from enchanted ...",0
26304," Cannon's first feature stands out because the genre has so rarely received a woman's touch, and it's evident in the way the movie pokes fun at masculinity by making it irrelevant.",1
178137," Chelsom ... loses control of this bloated production, allowing the story to get sloppy and dumb.",0
215690," [A Single Man] communicates the terrible grief of a man who lost his partner of 16 years and must keep his mourning, as he kept the relationship, secret.",1
38475," While it mostly avoids rom-com clichés and is grown-up enough to deal with sex frankly, it's also deeply vanilla and is saved only by an obvious spark between the two leads.",1
217550," There won't be a faster, more furious movie this year. ",1
206887," Pitt, toying with his death-wish like some private joke, is eminently watchable in a role with little developmental arc; while Affleck, as his unwitting nemesis, takes his own mysterious integrity right to the grave.",1
69234," Superbly directed, brilliantly written and emotionally engaging drama with a terrific central performance from Michelle Williams.",1
183130, It's a movie that falls flat after an explosive start.,0
103867," Ali motormouth footage left over from When We Were Kings. Actually, this whole film was made from WWWK leftovers, we learn. But we manage to forget that detail whenever the music soars.",1
62153, Kids will enjoy the day-glo pyrotechnics and mums and dads can revel in some of the most impressive CGI spectacle committed to celluloid.,1

235025," Toes the line between parody and deconstruction, but it transcends its subject matter rather than just subverting or co-opting it. ",1
170934," It's a noble effort, but aficionados and the mildly interested are recommended to seek out VH-1's excellent Studio 54 documentary in lieu of this shallow morality play.",0
155066, One is hard pressed to find any cinematic personality to Sunshine Cleaning.,0
222169, I'm left hoping that the sage of violent cinema will get back his former edge of ingenuity for something less toxic.,0
226358," The meat of the Sherlock Holmes franchise is quip-laced action, and Game of Shadows mostly delivers on that. ",1
5841, It is an encounter with the past that feels exhilaratingly present-tense.,1
147229," More character study than thriller (the title means ""revenge""), this slow-burning Austrian film effectively holds our interest with its unpredictable plot, even though it's not easy to care where it's going.",1
168877," Now that the fanboy hype has cleared, we can see Cloverfield for what it is: borrowed inspiration, trite screenwriting and amateurish acting all in the service of a ballsy idea.",0
109882," Reilly conjures a self-portrait that is insightful, hilarious and completely devoid of self-pity.",1
103003," The Revenant is a film of mud, blood, and carnage set against unforgiving northern wastes of snow and freezing water.",1

205043," With Bumblebee, the filmmaker Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings) presents the best Transformers film, as well as a light and entertaining film adventure. [Full review in Spanish]",1
190699, A delightful film that provides a kid-friendly story at the expense of dark realism.,1
54116," All posturing and artifice -- not cool or funny, though sometimes scary in its nihilism and flippancy.",0
51317," Much of the film feels like a demo reel containing lots of violence, but very little substance to back it up.",0
215930," Blackness may have lurked within the Potter heart, but you'd never know it from Miss Potter, which shifts the burden of ill humor onto the authoress's petit-bourgeois mother.",0
196931," I can imagine Sean Penn agreeing to star in this Taken knockoff on the condition that it educate moviegoers about humanitarian crises in Africa; it does, but the film feels misshapen as a result.",0
91379," Thomas Allen Harris's film offers a fascinating glimpse of the early campaigns of the African National Congress, and the way childhood memories can obscure larger truths.",1

90011," Moore is constitutionally incapable of being less than terrific onscreen, but this is some of her finest work, a performance of shattering intelligence and consumate grace.",1
176312, Begs for attention like a homeless puppy.,0
85326," The end result is a science-fiction saga so incoherent, so ugly and so pointless that you have to wonder why Warner Bros, is even bothering to distribute this embarrassment.",0
2888," It's an important subject, lucidly presented.",1
82576," Like the best sci-fi, Source Code is both entertaining and thought-provoking.",1
94882," Besides blatant chick flick romantic appeal, the mothers/daughters relationships hold a modicum of interest . . .plus an incidental memorial tribute to the late Levon Helm.",0
66407," It is one of the most timeless of all movies in terms of topic, emotion, acting and motivation.",1
120610," It's a forthright attempt to engage with this fascinating, opaque figure and show what it cost him personally.",1
172528, These movies lack a whole lot of panache.,0
213080," If you're in the mood for a true spectacle that's as dark as it delightful, you must see Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival in all its gory glory.",1
29333," Nobody's Fool does not veer from the Perry formula, but Haddish and Goldberg show that the right cast can elevate even the most predictable material.",1
211702," Dido in 'Belle' and Noni here wouldn't seem to have a lot in common, but both roles present Mbatha-Raw as a woman searching for her authentic self within a cultural context that prefers compromised or cartoonish representations of black identity.",1
216329," A sweet, life-affirming picture, but it's just not authentic or captivating enough to justify its wildly concocted scenario.",0
221237, Charles Edward Pogue and Cronenberg's intelligent script and Goldblum's heartfelt performance make this outlandish story perfectly feasible.,1
248152," The film ends in infectious good-humour. It seems perfectly calculated for its intended market, unlike Wolverine.",0
117283, The movie isn't good enough for me to want to decipher it's mysteries.,0
147752," As is commonplace in many of Hitchcock's films, there's a wry tension between the seemingly talky, classical Hollywood feel, and their very acute, psychoanalytical wanderings.",1
183491," [It has] all the raw ingredients of a cult classic. Why, then, is 'Dark Shadows' such a bore? ",0
215737," Birbiglia has assembled a Murderer's Row of comedic talent, and like any successful improv group they make one another look better throughout. ",1
224904, The film is heartfelt and often powerful but sometimes too sluggish to carry maximum impact.,1
176127," England is Mine, handsomely filmed for the wide screen, is an auspicious debut for Gill. Even those unfamiliar with Morrissey and his contribution to popular culture should be captivated.",1
117346, A strikingly impressive film debut.,1
53575," Bana is nothing short of brilliant: Even when the movie Chopper meanders, Bana's Chopper Read is utterly mesmerizing.",1
188882, The third installment gets a pass for undoing most of the damage done by the second. This is a trilogy that floats on faint praise.,1
177686," Billy Jean King wins. Not just the 1973 Battle of the Sexes tennis match against Bobby Riggs, but the hugely entertaining and inspiring movie of the same name. It's all aces. ",1
228396," Allegedly all these incidents connect symbolically in Barney's mind, but in the viewer's, they thud, inert and separate as stones.",0
126937," Call it wishful thinking, but what could have been an interesting look at the suffocating ideals of machismo expectedly becomes a celebration of it. ",0
222887," The new ""Star Wars"" was basically the first ""Star Wars,"" and the ""AbFab"" movie is basically a super-long episode of the show. Where the former's unoriginality stemmed from a lack of nerve, with the latter it's an act of defiance. ",1
110818, Avengers: Infinity War has taken all of the elements that have made past films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe work and given them a shot of steroids.,1
23743," Just when you thought there was no gas left in the tank of revisionist vampire cinema, along comes A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night.",1
249883," Blakeson, who worked low-budget wonders on The Disappearance of Alice Creed, handles the shifts and twists of the plot efficiently enough, but the result remains lumpen and crucially lacking in surprise.",0
127518," As soon as the lights went up in the theater, I told my viewing companions that I honestly felt that seeing the film was a privilege.",1
119376, Seemingly as cozy as The Gift of the Magi yet in reality more stinging than Revolutionary Road,1

186673," [A] visionary, jaw-dropping spectacle.",1
39472," A slow burn look at memory and reality, hope and forgiveness. ",1
70777," At no point did I give a monkey's about what happened to Nicholas Hoult's murderous, vacuous A&R man in this muddled Brit flick.",0
164745," Allen brings such conviction to the part that it's almost possible to look past the gaps in Mark's development. In the end, you may not buy each step he takes, but you respect Allen's attempt to make the effort seem genuine.",1
29900," There are so many dreams within dreams, I thought I might've been dreaming. 'Inception' isn't a bad movie, but I could never sit through it again. It's up to the viewer to decide whether or not they will ride it out with Prince Valium.",1
41374," A sprawling gangster movie epic that demonstrates Affleck's deft hand at tense, action filled filmmaking, and presenting characters in constant conflict with who they are and the environment they have cornered themselves into.",1
247967," There's a lot that grabs you, and then there's the ending, which is unfortunately so farcical that everything that came before it immediately sucks out the air in Bird Box's metaphorical balloon.",0

251749," Tatum holds his own. I can find many faults with The Eagle, but he is not one of them. ",0
133095," It's intense without becoming simplistic, and the actors stay focused as the viewpoints shift.",1
24736, The story goes a step too far after achieving the goal.,0
197417," ""Lion"" isn't revolutionary filmmaking, but as comfort food cinema goes, it carries requisite anxiety and release, making it palatable to the mass audience while still retaining some subtlety with periodically intense character examination. ",1
128796, It lifts an embarrassing number of beats from Die Hard... but Channing Tatum is no Bruce Willis.,0
93294," Overfamiliarity extends to the story, jokes and music, most of which reference popular entertainment of about 30 years ago.",0
2767," It doesn't get off to the strongest start but improves rapidly, thanks largely to the low-key but nicely winning performances delivered by Thomas Mann and R J Cyler as teenage buddies and amateur film-makers Greg and Earl.",1
4979," A poignant, unsettling and moving psychological drama about an unworldly 18-year-old novitiate nun.",1
201480," A fairly dull, thoroughly mediocre adventure--hardly the cinematic treatment Marvel's first family deserves.",0
11864," Drive is quite simply the best film that Michael Mann never made in the period where Thief, Manhunter and the scores of Giorgio Moroder and Tangerine Dream secreted off the screen and into our veins.",1
80607, Its evocative re-creation transports you to a very specific time without resorting to cheap nostalgia.,1
80022, It's a measure of Cavill's intelligence that you can feel him resisting Goyer and Snyder's most egregious errors of judgment as Man Of Steel shakes itself apart. ,0
136801," There's still time for beautifully contemplative scenes in the Gobi desert, praising a young chef in Kyoto or comparing notes about produce with a humble French gardener.",1
212059, It will delight the show's fans while winning over others unlucky enough never to have seen [Key & Peele].,1
200270, Avengers: Infinity War has trouble fitting in so many characters and giving them proper emotional moments as well as the fireworks in its 149 minute run time.,0
143726," Somehow, [it] works-like the music at its heart, there isn't much depth, but the glittering surface is entertaining enough to while away the night.",1
3933, Thornton's subversive performance as the type of guy parents warn their kids to stay away from is in this PG-13 movie a tad too profane for the preteens who would really dig it and too juvenile for most adults.,0
238," For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion.",0
10398," Too content with its own ""maturity"" and ""restraint,"" yet it invaluably offers Christie for audiences in delicate contemplation, and chaste consummation",1
31554," Unfortunately in Celebrity, Woody Allen's line of attack is compromised by his being at least half in love with the very glitterati he sets out to savage.",0
221594," The movie is much ado about nothing, feeling desperately thin and pointless. At first promising campy fun, it's soon simply mystifying, then misguided, gross and finally tiresome in its look-at-me-ness.",0
190175," A roller coaster of twists and turns, crosses and double-crosses, some of which strain belief but are entertaining in an ""Oh, now I get it!"" kind of way.",1
215302, Animals presents an authenticity often lacking in films about drug abuse. It largely has Dastmalchin's screenplay to thank.,1
29464," Just another example of middling, muddled Shakespeare.",0
72864, The ReZort fortunately stands out from the group as it offers a new spin on the well-worn genre.,1

37726," Wind River is violent and hard to watch, but gripping and telling with effective music.",1
237129, Loo and Lau have borrowed so liberally from sources like GoodFellas [that] they're essentially dressing it in one-size-fits-all gangster-movie clothes.,0
49980," There's not much fun to be had, and even less excitement. Mercifully, if feels like Jack Reacher has reached the end of the line.",0
5058," As far as American remakes of Japanese horror flicks go, this one's better than either The Ring or The Grudge.",1
36750," We get little flashes of story beats, but then it's on to the next thing - never enough to make us really invested in what's happening to these people.",0
158229," Never have so many curbside trash containers been violated in the name of art, as well as trees, a mailbox, and a forlorn electric pole.",0
158109," Look past the irony and stark, symmetrical detachment of the aesthetic and there is something fresh, mesmeric and deeply touching about Isle of Dogs and its tale of courage and loyalty. ",1
219396," There's building tension, and then there's cheaply toying with us. This movie is a prime example of the latter.",0
159044," This is a movie with no wit, no imagination, and no laughs throughout its two tedious hours.",0
76429, [T]akes what was no doubt a valiant and game-changing labor battle and turns it into another Brit flick that tries desperately to be adorable.,0
198794," Bright Star seems to be a lot about very little, a miniature projected to Imax size. So much goes unspoken that what remains seems almost trite.",0
164593," [A]n acerbic coming-of-age story, a warmly yearning nostalgia piece, and a smartly uproarious farce all in one...",1
150991," It's lovely and entertaining, the type of British film which makes you wonder why the simplicity of the human condition continually evades the grasp of Hollywood.",1
43243, A taut urban thriller with a hissable villain and an unforgettable ending. One of Stallone's best films.,1
156902, Nothing but an extensive knowledge of the DigiMythos will make the story of this animated feature the slightest bit comprehensible.,0
140956," In these hyper-dissociative times, [The Congress] may be just what the doctor ordered.",1
160300, It doesn't touch the heart as much as it thinks it does.,1
225228," If you feel like an antidote to the usual menu of cheery, cheesy and charitable Christmas movies this year, Rare Exports is for you. ",1
102355," Unfortunately, the culmination of the story is unsatisfactory and predictable. ",0
98105," Deliver Us From Evil is too glossy and loud, and too similar to other entertaining ""fright fests"". If Derrickson had pulled back a little he may have delivered a more convincing, original and unnerving film.",0
164103," Too muted and pensive to work as a thriller, too withdrawn to be a character study, and too cold to evoke any sympathy, the film is instead a dull and alienating exercise in how to take a strong actor and interesting premise and mostly waste them.",0
42346," Ricki is fun to be around, but like the memory of watching this, she's not the kind that sticks around.",1
231313," Given the excessive length and bombastic F/X, there's too much action and precious little poetry.",0

195, An inspirational movie that has little inspiration to call its own.,0
200524, Coward's champagne-fizz lightness has never felt so labored; nothing here comes easy.,0

193704, The result is a good Thor movie when post-Avengers we wanted a great one.,1
223008," If you're fed up with death and destruction in the movies, of superheroes and mutants and plots to destroy the planet, Little Men is the perfect antidote.",1
177822, What makes the film so powerful is that it shows how someone so unassuming can cause so much damage. It hits you with the startling revelation that sometimes good things happen to bad people.,1
165641," It's a real world ecological thriller that doesn't forget about the human story running through the heart of the narrative, and as such the film ends up being an avalanche of thrills and chills I cannot wait to watch again.",1
172366," Even as Kyle Killen's script becomes ever more implausible and ultimately ridiculous, it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen when the tortured and ill-looking Gibson is center stage.",1

246161, It barely gets by as a mediocre genre attempt. ,0
66034, Faithful to the story with a great cast. I DO believe a man can fly.,1

221176, It doesn't offer even a basic driving narrative that might at least have engaged our attention.,0
212146, 'Soul' is the one of the many things lacking in this sad excuse for a horror film.,0
71532," The young leads are charming and authentic, and the film reminds us all to embrace our own weirdness.",1
59947," An operatic tragicomedy of rivalry, jealousy, failure, and success.",1
152501," Lydia Tenaglia's alternately dreamy and gossipy documentary about celebrity chef Jeremiah Tower is heavy on the ""celebrity"" and frustratingly short on the ""chef."" ",0
11043," How Dream With the Fishes works is that the road movie and buddy movie formulas slowly dissolve from around Nick and Terry, who by the end of the movie stand revealed in three dimensions.",1
202544, An over-cooked affair that lacks much needed wit and humour to go alongside its self-aware art intentions.,0
239840, The wider canvas and extra detail work reportedly meant an additional 30% in negative cost. It was a sound investment.,1
128465," Pattinson is utterly convincing as the Manson-eyed Connie, a manipulative force of nature (alternately mesmerising, repugnant and pathetic) who leaves a trail of destruction in his wake.",1
100651," In other words, Sorry to Bother You is a surreal ride.",1
7092," Both sincere and cynical in its view of country stardom, it makes you forgive all of its false notes simply because the talent plays them with conviction. ",1

202154," It's a dynamite movie, and you can see it in the full 330-minute version or the 140-minute cut. Either way, see it. It'll knock you sideways.",1
176024, It's only a film like Khoon Bhari Maang that can turn a complete lack of logic into poignancy.,1
120757," Damon's the anchor, a fine one at that, but even he can't seem to hold the filmmakers' attention for long.",0
93379," Ultimately, Five Nights in Maine is a film that's centered on a heavy and sad subject matter that ends up feeling empty.",0
174340, A beautifully conceived and executed chamber comedy/drama with tragedy at its core.,1
241132, A classic comedy!,1
165038, A movie that turns a trip to the beach into a cruel metaphor about maturity without losing its sense of humor. [Full review in Spanish],1

208087," His fall and redemption are a little too familiar to carry the movie, but there's an odd hall-of-mirrors quality to all this: prone to quoting Requiem for a Heavyweight, Wepner is transmogrified into the movies himself.",1
147200, Leaves it up to use to find metaphoric meaning.,1
132415," With all the digital and environmental tomfoolery, it's a shock that Chipwrecked wasn't released in 3D, and that renders it ever so slightly more respectable. But seriously, Jason Lee, you're so much better than this. Please, stop now.",0
123241, What's the statute of limitations on youthful optimism? How many poor saps joined the military thinking Beetle Baileyonly to discover it was Full Metal Jacket?,0
184216," For a Michael Bay action film, Transformers was surprisingly entertaining and not as heavy handed.",1
43018," Persistence pays, so says this rocketeering children's fantasy. It's a claim this delightful computer-animated film also proves.",1
211879," Bears is entertaining, suitably suspenseful, and amusing, boosted by Reilly's enthusiasm and the natural appeal of its stars.",1
161232, The movie works because of two main things: empathy and the well crafted ambiguity of its characters. [Full review in Spanish],1

163141, Its only interest now is in its representation of its era.,0

7901," It has the plastic, disinfected aroma of something straight off the assembly line.",0
19807, Neither the script's conspiracies nor Nicolas Cage's performance is weird enough to trump the film's generic feel...,0
225368," Action may seem slow in coming, but interest never flags and Winocour doesn't flinch from necessary violence. Hollywood awaits her, if she's interested.",1

66353, Decent trash that could have been delicious trash with a little more daring.,0
132491," The low tech nature of All is Lost accentuates the primal (physical) nature of this struggle, while the technical prowess of Gravity emphasizes its more metaphysical (and less interesting) nature",1
39511," Logan is not really asking us to consider the plight of vulnerable children, it's encouraging us to get off on it.",0
176084," Although no one comes off looking especially good, an acceptable alternate title for the film could be ""The Ugly Americans.""",0

85622," never feels more than surface, more than flash.",0
232543, A beautiful film with a wonderful young cast that flows with sinister sorcery and tender sympathy for the physical and emotional upheavals of adolescence.,1
114156," Darkly moving (I never thought I'd weep for a diplodocus). The franchise can't go forward, its eternal weakness - but Bayona mixes it up with meta wit and verve. Goldblum is an occasional, iconic presence; I almost believed the cod-philosophy he spouts.",1
96834," It ends like a TV show, and everyone has learned a neat little lesson. Phooey.",0
7916, Adamson overcomes some of the book's better-read-than-spoken dialogue and the odd bits of chunky plotting with plenty of grace and charm.,1

179528, The handling of the violence seems like that line about jesting at scars if you never felt a wound.,0

152296," Manuscripts Don't Burn is more rueful than action-packed, yet it simmers with righteous refusal. That's what gives the movie a power no Bourne flick will ever match.",1
146294," Not a cheery movie, but it is a frequently hilarious one. The monster, as terrifying as it is, also has the timing of a crack comedian, and filmmaker Bong Joon-ho sees no contradiction in interrupting a tense chase scene for a wayward bit of comedy.",1
142426," The film's charm offensive breaks down most of the narrative barriers to enjoyment, and with Erykah Badu and Tracy Morgan making great hay with their roles, this turns out to a fun film.",1
176688," The Rock is the Guy Movie to end all Guy Movies, a ridiculously overblown summer testosterone blowout right down to the Wagnerian strains of the soundtrack and its stunningly high body count. It's also a hell of a lot of fun.",1
221710," FALLEN KINGDOM Brings Action, Forgets Characters, Awe",0
141839, Director Kirk Jones finds little to love about child rearing in this movie adapted by Shauna Cross and Heather Hach from Heidi Murkoff's advice manuals...,0
132407, So what if the 3D is perfunctory? The drawing is terrific.,1
243065," The power of the ending comes from the inherent pain of loss, but it's no feat to recognize how emotional this would be, to tell us it's coming and to dangle it in front of us for an hour and a half.",0
49719," Setting a mercifully brisk pace for the often long winded adventures, the story reaches a safe berth in a little over two hours.",1
149043," Kenner's sympathies are clear - ""Don't let them stack the deck!"" the film proclaims - and ultimately Merchants of Doubt does a much better job of making you think than convincing you of what to think.",1
128915, All that's missing are commercials for estrogen cream and erectile-dysfunction meds.,0
172140," This minimalist thriller offers the same endurance-test nightmare as Open Water, only here the imperilled characters are marooned on a mountain, and wolves substitute for the sharks.",1
131649," In the hands of a lesser actor, this would feel just as clichéd as it sounds. But Caine brings his smarts as well as his baggage to the character, making him more than another mad-as-hell guy with a gun.",1
232392," These are not horrible people, just ones who flung themselves enthusiastically toward the American dream as so many do.",1

179763, The Searchers meet Independence Day. Great fun. ,1
230621, Brooklyn's Finest is an entertaining rehash of every cop movie cliche committed to celluloid.,1
186865," Bernie delivers an abundance of belly laughs, but at its center is a confounding act committed by a man too beloved to be hated and a community too passionate to think clearly.",1

69048, A truly wondrous film of love and renewal.,1

89339," A series of plotless, episodic incidents that slowly build to understated emotional crescendos.",1
183988," With his sophomore effort, The Homesman, Jones gives us a revisionist Western that defies expectations at every turn. It's a genuine art film in the vein of Aussie productions like The Proposition.",1
158827," The ride is worth it for the uniformly terrific cast and for the aspirations of this throwback science-fiction vehicle, when brainy stories drove films rather than Star Wars-style eye candy.",1
27269, Another attempt to adapt a young adult novel that fails to justify the adaptation.,0
226352," A decidedly mixed bag, this homage to exploitation films shows the idiosyncratic approach, strengths and weaknesses of its helmers. Comparison of two segments is inevitable and so opinions will differ; I much prefer Rodriguez's over the top zombie flick",1

5432," Beautiful film about WWII has intense themes, drinking.",1
96120, This is the sort of ho-hum production that will likely seem less disappointing on a smaller screen.,0

229322, Reasonably absorbing.,1
28508," You could call this film a horrible combination of The Heat and Date Night, but I think the best way to describe it is a spectacular waste of time.",0
57236," The term genius is overused these days, but I cannot think of a better word to describe director Peter Jackson and his breadth of vision which brings J.R.R. Tolkien's work to life. ",1
62158," An occasionally amusing, but also lightweight, scattered, and ultimately less successful comedy than Allen's last outing. (Full Content Parental Review also available)",0
168224," The material isn't up to Van Sant's abilities, and the impression of ""Restless"" is of a filmmaker playing with familiar themes and searching for an adequate vessel.",0
193363," A ticking time bomb of harrowing action, frazzled nerves, and edge-of-your-seat mystery. But, at the same time, it is way too long and its plot far too complex and convoluted",1
173282, It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen.,0
110822, There is only so much twirling in wheat fields a person can handle before it starts to come off as a mockery of itself.,0
30679," If you're a hardcore computer gamer inured to marathon sessions of annihilation while being pulverised by Death Metal from wall-to-wall speaker stacks, this may be the movie for you. For myself, not so much.",0
136221, An undeniably ambitious but ultimately torpid and silly tale of an alien on the prowl.,0
66927," The dialogue addresses our expectations, gets us laughing and stops the movie from becoming too obvious a character study.",1
18121," Other than the sheer peculiarity of the incident - and the obvious fun Spacey and Shannon are having as alpha males parrying and thrusting over Dr Pepper and M&M's - it's difficult to discern the point of ""Elvis & Nixon.""",0
145811, ... this time around the ordeal is less grueling than simply distasteful.,0
129726," A film that can't decide whether it wants to be ""Raging Bull"" or ""Remember the Titans."" In the end, it's a little too much of both.",0
186189, Takeshi Kitano is one of the best filmmakers working today.,1
44480," Professor Marston and the Wonder Women is a terrific story of finding acceptance, challenging the norm, and debating ideas in an intelligent instead of belligerent manner.",1
161006," I didn't walk out of Monster with that ""great"" movie feeling, which is not to say it wasn't ""great."" Profound fits better.",1
24747," Down To Earth is mostly a slapdash effort, racing through time-tested material as if it can't wait to show off Rock's routines at the climax.",0
231840," These offerings by Howard and Goldsman are not enough to turn a page-turner into something that survives and transcends a media phenomenon, in the way of such bad novels as The Godfather and Jaws.",0

135577, Tremendously emotional. [Full review in Spanish],1
194965, A rare specimen in our postironic age: legitimately unintentional camp.,0
24542, By carrying such little significance to the movie - no one watches a Fast and Furious film for its literate script - the plot can stand to be as illogical as it is under-developed. ,0
116763," Thackeray's lumbering, episodic narrative rarely comes to life. Even Witherspoon's trademark perkiness seems muted and dulled.",0
100416," Adapted and directed by Oscar-winning scribe Alan Ball (American Beauty), Towlehead plays like a kinkier, less-focused riff on theme explored with greater rigor and verve in his 1999 scenario.",0

160929," It's a film to make you weep with sorrow and anger, and one of the most necessary films of the year.",1
20072, The film has hilarious moments but much of the comedy of the film relies on uncontrolled eschatology. [Full review in Spanish],0
171691," An unpleasant, redundant drama that features perceptive acting from Green.",0
113110, The kick of the first movie was the pleasurable shock of humans and these transformative mechanical beings interacting. The third chapter is dedicated to little more than wanton destruction.,0
234780," ""I, Frankenstein"" isn't the monstrosity we'd feared. But it's still not good.",0

88923," Despite it being too long, not entirely convincing and being disgustingly but accurately described as a dra-medy, it's still funny as hell.",1
58284, Its lenght and lack of that characteristical 'Tarantino shine' of his more famous body of work make a rewatch of this film a necessary to develop a taste for it. [Full Review in Spanish],1

231672, Drama of a female teen and her gang in a tough Paris project delivers some fine acting but is wobbly in its story of the young heroine's sad journey into an ugly early adulthood.,0
153070," I expected ""Premium Rush"" would be an exciting film, but I didn't think it would be so much fun to watch. It has plenty of thrills, laughs and a plot that is more complicated and interesting than I thought it would be.",1

23642, Sun spends so much time on the mood and atmosphere that he forgets about the story.,0
214775," Slumdog Millionaire, a film so upbeat and colourful that, by the time you're relaying its infectious air of optimism to friends, you could forget that it features orphans, slaughter, organised crime, poverty, enslavement and police brutality.",1
178035," I haven't been involved this little in a world where the title suggests otherwise since ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" gave us just ten minutes of dinobots. ",0
58112, This adaptation of a prize-winning Australian novel is a stodgy slog save for some sporadic moments of blunt force supplied by Judy Davis and Charlotte Rampling.,0
181149," A film with a playful and noble essence, Bumblebee manages to mix Transformers with the nostalgia of the 80s and it's better than it sounds. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
216367, They just don't make this kind of romantic trifle anymore-and for good reason.,0
223939, Remember when The Da Vinci Code was a thing?,0
103498," A whimsy-free business, in Wonderland, of all places! There could be no more ironic stand-in for today's franchise-mad movie marketplace, here to lop the heads off any and all creative personnel.",0
130276, Gray expertly shows the massiveness of these undertakings ... and also the spirit of adventure required of someone who knows nature can't be tamed but can't stop trying.,1
126623, It feels like Sandler & Co. just sort of showed up to the set in sweatpants to horse around with the props and they filmed it. ,0
37724," There's something for everyone here, but especially people who want to see weird jokes using Carl's empty eye socket.",1
13551, There is a curious absence of development in this film.,0
50122," Doctor Strange is basically a reboot of Iron Man, only with a lot more prettier things to look at while you're stoned. It's a good strategy. And it works.",1
65854, Rene Clement's subversive direction makes us root for Delon to pull off a tricky tightrope disguise as suspicious police pursue him from hotel to apartment and town to town.,1
130200," The film is lumpy and self-conscious, the dialogue not very witty.",0
97635," Like the Toy Story films, Cars is a state-of-the-computer-art plea on behalf of outmoded, wholesome fifties technology, with a dash of Zen by way of George Lucas.",1
38647," At first ""Apprentice"" seems to be a basic revenge film in which Aiman stalks the man who killed his father. But it becomes psychologically more complex ...",1
214586," [A] slothful, indulgent sequel that sees a once-great screen comedian hit self-inflicted Sandlergeddon.",0
210642," For much of its length, the movie consists of battle scenes. They are not as lucid and easy to follow as the events in 'Black Hawk Down,' but then the terrain is different, the canvas is larger, and there are no eyes in the sky to track troop movements.",1
185182," ...a film with meager production values about an odd woman and what she did to inspire the British tabloids...not for everybody, but for some it might have a morbid fascination. ",0
49553, Director Robert Eggers has writen and directed one of the best debut films in recent movie history. [Full review in Spanish],1
176401, A surprisingly well-paced and satisfying kung-fu adventure that honors its stars and treats their story respectfully.,1
102642," Blessed with considerable virtues, including a clever concept, crackling filmmaking and a charismatic star, it ultimately squanders all of them, undone by an unfortunate lack of subtlety and restraint.",0
142008," A good filmmaker can make grim material watchable, but it takes a great one (or two) to make it fun.",1
143778," Lacking energy and pace and enslaved by a ghastly score, this tepid movie left me longing alternately for David Lean's thrillingly grim 1948 masterpiece, and Carol Reed's chipper 1968 sing-along, with pretty tunes by Lionel Bart.",0
244684," Plenty entertaining, but consistent with most of Brosnan's Bonds, a few misguided decisions keep it from being a classic.",1
78634," Palo Alto is as fuzzy, scattered and aimless as its protagonists' lives.",0
3738, The Book of Eli has something extremely thoughtful to say and it was designed to make you think about what it is saying. This film grew on me in a big way.,1
64365," There's a lean, tough, streamlined film to be found here; the main problem is that Bullhead, just like its protagonist, is artificially bulked up until what's underneath is barely visible.",0
250743," Like the ending or not, the film finds strength in the performances by Gyllenhaal and Russo. Their work is as captivating to watch as a police chase on a Los Angeles freeway.",1
54200," Even if most of the plot's twists and turns are fairly obvious, it's amusing to watch the balance of power shift between the characters. And no one is just along for the ride.",1
246459," There are moments that stir, and it's always lovely, but it's generally too remote to gain hold of you truly.",1
78756," Built on dynamic set pieces and jet black humour, it's reminiscent of last year's Drive. It's a shame then, that Dominik saddles the film with a heavy-handed political subtext that would echo much louder if it spoke a little quieter.",0
57635," Who among the great filmmakers has put the workings of the human psyche front and center and made it so intellectually engrossing? Hitchcock? Bergman? Maybe, but I really can't remember laughing very much at Vertigo or Persona.",1
2806," Much as I love the performances here, the film just generally leaves a sour taste. ",0
165485," Mr. Fogel could be considered either daring or foolhardy for his initial plan. But his work with Dr. Rodchenkov is levelheaded, and his documentary illuminating.",1
62516," Norah Shapiro captures a slice of life that's as commanding as it is heartening. Time for Ilhan will restore your faith in the political system, small as it may be, and show you the revolution that's being started and continues today!",1
180087, This remake exists for no clear reason at all. It doesn't even make sense and the action is dull and repetitive.,0
22801," Before we see anything, our ears are chilled by composer John Williams' menacing two note soundtrack which then builds into that unforgettable frenzy as the unseen shark savages its first victim.",1
122094," Laugh-out-loud funny, with less sugar and more teen spirit than the likes of High School Musical.",1
196415," The only saving grace for 'Bottle Shock' is the finale, which features Rickman laying down the rules -----",0
142910, What starts as an interesting look at a man who singularly inspired a lot of violent perpetrators becomes an unnecessarily hectoring judgment of someone who's already been punished for his youthful bravado.,0
65073," I think kids can get on board with most of what this latest edition offers; as a lifelong fan of the franchise I only wish that the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" got to be in their own movie more.",0
197091, A glorious flight of the imagination.,1
251826," The transition is grating, the compelling Cassidy giving way to an abrasive Portman, one curdled by celebrity, her accent coarser, her persona more fragile despite outward appearances, the Ouroboros personified.",0
243892, Enormous fun from beginning to end. Here's hoping we don't have to wait too long for Part 2.,1
60597," A couple battle sequences are filmed with great care, but War Horse is still essentially a trite, manipulative soap opera run through the lens of World War I to give it a lot of historic and artistic sensibility.",0
21427," A sharply observed but bleak examination of family dysfunction, anchored by solid performances.",1
95260," An engrossing film, even for those who don't consider themselves fashion connoisseurs.",1
121188, A watchable but never pulsating portrait of mayoral wheeling-dealing.,0
140201," Rogen and Goldberg start with spoofery and work their way into something bolder and stranger; it's as if playing in the Pixar sandbox, or a reasonable approximation thereof, can't help but inspire creativity.",1
9373," Still fit and doing quite a few of his own stunts, Chan is an action hero with considerable charm.",0
97478," Try not to think too hard about it, and Escape Plan is stupid, stupid fun.",0
36358," The sort of thing your Dad might watch on his day off work, and then completely forget about.",0
102234," For all its audacity, a misguided folly.",0
10841," The Interrupters, a documentary about an initiative to stop urban violence in Chicago, may be the most necessary film you'll see this year.",1
11267," This gentle comedy, set in the midst of Glasgow's ice cream wars, still resonates with its superbly observed characters.",1
223884, I've never seen a restaurant documentary that seemed less interested in showing the joy of food.,0
61973," the majority of the movie is built entirely around Enslin's scary safari into his subconscious, and Cusack gives a high-powered performance that never fails to hold your attention.",1
27996," Colette has the graceful visual trappings of a costume drama but is driven by an electric, erotic mood. ",1
205944," ...shows some gritty visual flair, but too much of this material feels familiar, right down to the climactic showdown and the obligatory pulsating soundtrack.",0
166848," Kate and Leo just stand around shouting the subtext at one another, mired in that typical Mendes swamp of gloss wherein every shot looks like a picture from a coffee-table book.",0
52642," John Woo and Nicolas Cage do little to enhance their reputations with this one, which is not to say that an indiscriminate war film buff might not get a fix out of the action content here.",0
152544," Put simply, one of the greatest movies ever made.",1
217667," Jim Jarmusch's most lucid, satisfying, and flat-out gorgeous feature since Dead Man.",1
125854," For the rest of its plodding length, the movie wallows in its rich costumes, sumptuous wigs and stately, dignified repartee.",0
228989," This is not your dad's ""Frankenstein,"" more is the pity, and time would be better spent watching the marvelous 1931 original.",0
116794," MacDonald does quite well in his dramatic feature debut with solid performances from the cast. Backcountry is satisfyingly intense, although quite gory in patches.",1
106191," A great piece of populist outrage and a dangerously good comedy about a looming American tragedy, as Moore details the lock-hold on American health care by drug and insurance companies, and the eagerness of politicians to be bought into submission by them",1
179050," Hostel is more artfully horrific than the usual gore flick, and more truly scary. It's a small classic of its awful kind. ",1
178546," With great power and subtlety, Farhadi transforms this ugly quarrel into a contemporary tragedy.",1
242342, ...argues for an eternal childhood.,1
94872," ""Runner Runner"" is the kind of meat-and-potatoes genre picture that might be passable if the people involved in making it had given the same thought and concentration to the development of the plot and the ending as they did to the fairly involving set-up.",0
12415," It's a little sentimental, and the finale feels rushed, but along the way it's great fun.",1
67697," For its sheer sweep and occasional smarts, Invictus is worth a look, but by no means should this triumph-of-the-underdog feel-gooder be considered a definitive history of South Africa's historical transition of power.",1
14367, Ryūsuke Hamaguchi's follow-up to 2015's acclaimed Happy Hour is a romanceless dud with a clumsy conceit. ,0
169724, There's a regrettable lack of comic ingenuity in how this installment mines the well-worn trope of coping adult daughters and set-in-their-ways matriarchs not getting along.,0
185296," A fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience. Judging by those standards, 'Scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary.",1
174171," It's clunky, aimless and not especially funny.",0
48809," Like the mild gags and vocal talents of Rihanna, the animation is constantly bright, maintaining an upbeat tone to the film as typical themes such as friendship and individuality are addressed.",1
229119," The performances have an unforced swagger that defies the limited parameters of the characters themselves (nobody gets a lot of screen time, not even the famously bulked-up George Clooney), and Gaghan's ear for real-world dialogue is almost peerless.",1
191704," Based on the Ray Bradbury short story of the same name, this is a colassal disapopintment - unworthy of the memorable source material.",0
224030," Where the original was... fresher than a boatload of day scallops, the part deux follow-up feels more like daily gruel. ",0
34440," The zipping speed of the storytelling even drips down into the minutiae of the editing, with cuts occurring on opening doors, or using visual cues with dialogue: the story never calms down for a second.",1
175879," Returning to the female-centric style with which he made his name, Almodovar demonstrates he's a film-maker who retains a master's touch.",1
152835, A satire that sets its sights too high and elicits only a few laughs here and there.,0
185527," Even when we feel as if we've seen it all before, there is a distinct realness about the narrative that lifts things above the mundane.",1
109279, Give Stallone credit for originality--turning a sports pic into a trip down memory lane.,1
114304, An almost bearable indie slice of life dramedy.,0
50475, Has a mixture of bloodletting and exultation that would make Sam Peckinpah sit up in his grave and howl with pleasure.,1
63018," The humour is shamelessly lowbrow, but its slapstick will appeal to mischievous children wanting a laugh -- or ideas on how to torment their parents.",1

127363," ""... There is a been-there-done-that feeling permeating all of 'Dark Shadows,' no matter how entertaining it might be at times.",0
61469," [Vaughan's] latest picture, a genre mash-up that sends the Sixties-era Bond-style gentleman spy on a collision course with the supporting cast of Kidulthood, is his most gratuitous slaughterfest yet.",0
222086," In telling their story in such a beautiful way, Sickles and Santini seem to realize how precious what Dina and Scott have before they do, but then again, it's hard not to fall for Dina, or her film.",1
193647, The pacing is uneven but the best scenes exert a powerful grip.,1
202629, Irresistibly laugh-out-loud and feel-good.,1
133586, Deeply ponderous and uninvolving.,0
227055," Not only does Robin Williams play a retarded man with fake teeth, but he also gets to wear old-age makeup. It's the schmaltz trifecta!",0
249536, That Johnny Depp's take on the Mad Hatter is comparatively one of the more subdued performances tells you just how out there Tim Burton's film is.,1
77058," The result is a viscerally unsettling experience, and a testament to the enduring relevance of the study's findings on the psychology of incarceration.",1
230675," A strained, relentless quest for gross-out humor and outlandish sexual escapades.",0

102983," It certainly looks the part for a major studio release, and the story, based on real events, is one that deserves to be brought before a wider audience.",1
90065," Verbal play and smartass-ery weaves through Wallflower, but it's of the predictable variety rather than the wryly observant commentary we'd hope for, like when a bored teen drawls: ""That works on so many levels.""",0
6515," A Sapphic Nancy Drew Mystery on the Lost Highway ... When it comes to Lynch, the journey is always more interesting than the destination",1
235040," The movie, directed by Bill Condon, provides a showcase for Mr. McKellen, who in real life is 76; watching every moment of his performance is pure pleasure.",1
60041, Horror super producer Jason Blum delivers a Friday the thirteenth dud. Truth or Dare is painfully slow and tedious with an absurd plot. ,0
117238," Aside from this historical overreach, the movie's inherent cheesiness was partly redeemed by a gallant performance by Fraser as the earnest Harry.",1
107597," Here, in scenes of quiet emotion, devastating violence, sweeping chaos and tranquil hope,is a profound conclusion to an unforgettable trilogy-the best American trilogy ever made.",1
133471," ""Inherent Vice,"" meandering even by Anderson's standards, is easily the worst of his movies, a soporific 2 /₂- hour endurance test.",0

53327," [Director Robert Redford] deftly articulates the moral morass that can arise when idealism gives way to reality; he also has some very definite things to say about the way today's sensation-hungry, click-addicted media operates.",1

237636," A movie that's not just very good, but also trés bien.",1
94116," ""Master and Commander"" is stylishly made, well acted, but it commits the ultimate sin of being ""blah."" There's a whole lot of ""Swash"" but very little ""Buckling.""",0

15943, Lewd and crude as well as warm and endearing. But mostly it is just laugh out loud funny.,1
19850, A kick-ass action flick that feels more like 3D than most of the recent films actually employing the technology yet it also manages to comment on the violent action it creates and celebrates.,1

108054," Clever, wise and outrageous, ""Juno"" comes at you with no holds barred.",1

82120," On one level a fascinating refraction of the Amanda Knox trial into an examination of perception, on another an increasingly trying hall of mirrors.",1
217460, The production really serves the material with camera work which makes the ordinary disturbing.,1
152056," Starts off great with solid humor but somewhere along the line it becomes stale, repetitive and annoying. Batman isn't some emo, wannabe beat boxer who is in love with Barbara Gordon.",0
99289, Brothers: Blood Against Blood is a surprisingly fast-paced and engaging drama rooted in subjects that never grow old.,1
96407," If Steven Spielberg, Michael Bay, and Tim Burton collaborated on an Amblin-style adventure with rocket launchers it might look something like Big Game.",1
173190, The highest-grossing Japanese film of all time is a luxuriously animated legend of ancient gods going head to head with mankind and industry over the balance of nature.,1
132198, A lethargic movie that lopes and stumbles far more often than it springs to life.,0
19880, Zemeckis shows he still has a vivid visual sensibility and a finger on the zeitgeist. But the script by John Gatins leaves nothing up in the air and returns all the tray tables locked in their upright positions.,1

227146," Spending more observational time with her smart, resilient and stirringly positive subjects -- even seeing less-edited footage of their business plan speeches -- might have helped sell her inspirational story.",0
33362," Offers a few inspired moments in a sea of mediocre gags, fumbled opportunities and that great foul among contemporary comedies--unnecessary grossness.",0

46322," While the concept is novel - and the animation often dazzling - the story and characterisations soon prove trite, condescending and dull.",0
206933, The deadening and sometimes laughable litany of shouted military-style dialogue eventually pummels into submission any hope for fresh creative angles on this well-worn format.,0

198069, Thornton and his directors have yet to master the subtlety between an endearing drunk and a sadist.,0

18513, The Hate U Give is a must-see drama with shining performances from Amandla Stenberg and Russell Hornsby.,1
29966," It's a plodding, plonking, clonking, clanking vanity project, watching which is like drowning in suet or being alone for two hours in the kind of airless hotel room that Hughes reputedly holed up in.",0
208863, Here is the most important thing you need to know about this movie: Larry the Cable Guy has top billing.,1

163368, Utterly unaware of its own absurdity.,0

189035, Inevitability of the plotting and lack of modulated rhythm make the 97-minute running time feel longer than it is.,0
87501, This may be the bucket of blood that splatter fans were eagerly anticipating ... but it is also an excellent horror film with solid scripting and strong performances that make it appealing to a wider audience.,1

68714, An entertaining if slightly skewed documentary about the short life and early death of General Motors' EV1.,1

181986," It is remarkable how, with all of the advances in technology over the years, a story like this can remain largely unchanged despite a 35 year gap between tellings. By allowing the movie to unfold in real time, Scott enhances the level of suspense.",1

128421," By the power of great messages, this one still entertains.",1
173481," This movie ought to be brainless summer fun. I'm sorry it isn't. No one expects Shakespearean dialogue or plotting in a movie based on the jiggly TV series of the 1990s, but even the breeziest summer escapism shouldn't be this stupid.",0

38153, La Haine chucks a Molotov cocktail through the sedate window-front of modern French cinema. Kassovitz has scoured away the layers of nuance and the portraits of a privileged past -- and daubed over them slogans of despair that are raw and contemporary.,1
208422," Inevitably, the film has the air of an extended campaign ad, but that doesn't make its subjects and the stories they tell any less compelling.",1

19357, The moral murkiness of the Israel-Palestine conflict sets the scene for a blistering espionage thriller.,1
44524," The movie is fluid, suspenseful, and preposterous-although, more historically than psychologically, and not necessarily in a negative sense.",1
22922," Brilliant adaptation, revised and refined, from the romantic novel by Patricia Highsmith. One of the best films of the year. [Full review in Spanish]",1
67515, It's more interested in borrowing terminal cancer as a narrative shorthand for intensity than investigating it as a lived experience. ,0
23643," This is misogyny and regression masquerading as comedy, and Sharma seems to be too busy trying to morph into a Hindi film hero to employ his famous comic timing to good effect. ",0

96302," A buoyant comedy that contains moments of pathos, this silent black-and-white movie recalls Singin' in the Rain but possesses a reverence that's endearingly French.",1
90749," The overall impression is one of unbridled enthusiasm on the part of the film's makers, both for its predecessors and for the brave new universe Abrams and his crew are exploring.",1

107067, It takes a while to get going and never outstrips its theatrical origins but gets by on great actors working through meaty scenes. See it for Streep vs Redford alone.,1

130054, Unspeakably bad dialogue delivered by excruciatingly bad actors in a plot so illogical and stupid it kills unicorns.,0
246022," Should end up one of the year's best dramas, an intricate, jolting look at life out of control and one woman's fight to hold onto her dignity and love in the midst of unimaginable tragedy. It's not an easy story to watch. Imagine living it.",1
53967," André Téchiné is a master at taking life experiences and stripping them of sentimentality, leaving us with only the bare-bones honesty of relationships and desire.",1

59167," Sabotage ultimately reinforces Schwarzenegger's iconic image, especially in a coda that looks upon the actor with such unreserved awe it nearly plays like one of Danny's Jack Slater daydreams deleted from the final cut of Last Action Hero.",1
64311," Director Steven Soderbergh returns to the cinema of anxiety he explored in 2013's Side Effects. Here, he wraps a lump of toxic masculinity in a thick layer of mental distress and deep fries it in rancid insurance malfeasance...Nasty and spot-on.",1

73824, The Impossible is simply unable to become the electrifying piece of work one might've expected.,1

232885," From bow to stern, Chandor delivers pure cinema.",1
46801, Depp and the rest of the cast (except Cumberbatch) make for a good ensemble. The problem is that the script does not know where to go and becomes an empty experience. [Full review in Spanish] ,0
175752," Suffice to say whatever illusions of a comeback M. Night Shyamalan may have had are likely shattered, like so many of Elijah Price's brittle bones. ",0
66002," A truly great film, one that puts a human face on adventure by starkly dramatizing the power of man's indefatigable resolve.",1
201817," Despite the filmmakers' efforts to humanize Wilson, however, Bill W. still dabbles in hagiography, valorizing the man while also painting him as a reluctant hero.",0

249399," Allen is only there as a punchline machine, and I spent most of the movie looking for his 'off' button.",0
153896," It is fine and dandy if 300: Rise Of An Empire is the type of erratic cinema smorgasbord that some may feel drawn to in the orgy of grossness, nudity, debauchery and tawdriness...[an] empty-minded salacious spectacle ",0

140157," While I think it's a worthwhile doc, it runs too long and paints a rather (unintended, I believe) poor portrait of McQueen.",0
181217," While we don't learn that he secretly ate children after the cameras stopped rolling, it's still a jolt to discover what an active and sometimes tormented mind he had.",1
236078," In Coscarelli's reprehensibly lazy adaptation, much of which is copied note-for-note from Pargin's book, shit happens at a furious pace, and almost none of it is adequately explained. ",0

174977," It's a skilfully crafted mix of classic filmmaking and modern-day storytelling, bracingly entertaining and packing a strong thematic kick.",1
76415," Based on a true story, the action keeps the film flowing smoothly without becoming preachy. As one of the last films of the summer season, ""War Dogs"" is definitely one to watch before you end your summer vacation.",1
41691," The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part One is very good indeed and all the better for featuring no Hunger Games at all.",1
154849, The lack of focus ultimately leaves too much of it as surface level when we really needed to get under the skin of Leo and Sofya Tolstoy in the way these great performers deserved.,0
159831," Feet and fists move with the camera, and angles orient the combatants in space. Even Reeves-who has a stiff-legged, Frankenstein's-monster-like fighting style-ends up looking like a formidable physical presence.",1
38194," A very entertaining, pure breed, old school western with a modern twist - and mesmerizing casting",1
165655," Corporations are out to get you, and you need to be afraid. You need to lock your back door at night and keep a gun under your pillow.",1

201906," When a movie throws as much at you as Devdas does, it's easy to forgive minor disappointments.",1
18258," Skilfully directed, the film is perfectly poised between real and unreal and manages to be both emotionally rich and disturbingly creepy, remaining ambiguous to the end.",1
89457, Rodrigo Garcia [is] known for his female ensemble dramas but demonstrates no particular affinity for this material.,0
232893," Even critics of this surreal postmodern narrative will acknowledge the rich female roles played by the best actresses today: Catherine Keener, Emily Watson, Dianne Wiest, Michelle Williams, Hope Davis, Samantha Morton, Jennifer Jason Leigh.",1
98628," Part exploitation flick, part non-preachy message picture, this fractured love-in, scripted by Jack Nicholson and told almost entirely through rapid-fire visuals, is a fascinating period piece.",1

3548, [An] unpolished but ultimately intriguing film...,1
141830," If dumbness is a large part of our problem, then The Brady Bunch Movie is a small (and oddly cheery) part of its solution.",1
167886, We never come to understand the magic that keeps Farrell looking like a member of My Chemical Romance for 10 decades. We never know why consumption makes women sexy.,0
208273, A major summer movie fumble...it's mostly the audience that gets sacked.,0
73096, Expertly assembled to draw out the suspense of danger lurking around each vacant hill... the movie creates a world of paradoxical sentiments: immediate decision-making pitted against the immovable forces of ideology and moral codes.,1
142943, The enigmatic band gives virtuoso music-video director Kahlil Joseph access to its Haitian influences but keep the audience rather more at arm's length from their creative process.,1
250831," Kudos to Anderson and Gilroy for making a low-action, dialogue-heavy geopolitical thriller in this day and age.",1

167471, It's so caught up in concept and layout that it frequently forgets to push the jolt buttons.,0
92634, ...primarily a movie about the disruptive and empowering effects of female nudity -- which is kinda cool. Too bad about the ending.,0
212879," An interesting and personal piece of work, presented by Lenny's son Jamie, who, despite his own problems and brushes with the law - and what I think might be undiagnosed depression - is engaging, intelligent and likable.",1
27539, Julia Roberts and Lucas Hedges pour their hearts and souls into the unflinching and unforgettable addiction drama about a mother who can't quite trust the son she loves. ,1
139520, Vividly captures the frustrating randomness of fame.,1
23628," Not the most enthralling Studio Ghibli animated feature, but the restrained story of a boy, a girl, and their beloved high school campus, circa 1963 in Yokohama, nevertheless creeps up on us emotionally in the best Ghibli fashion.",1
246144, Devilish fun that comes with a welcome side-order of B-movie ridiculousness.,1
64479," ... no improvement, unless one should care to marvel all over again at the utter lack of chemistry between [George] Clooney and Julia Roberts.",0

114511, The funniest bits are when the mimicry and the insults converge.,1
118931, The melodrama that has room to breathe in Hardy's 1874 novel (and the 170-minute 1967 adaptation of the story) is so rushed here that it looks faintly ridiculous.,0
157055," The lukewarm female talk occasionally grates and the men are portrayed as mind-numbingly simplistic, but on the whole this cyber-Cupid exercise is surprisingly affecting.",1

10605," Performances can get you a long way, but when you reduce such important events to a mere montage, then justice is clearly not being done to them and the memory of Mandela's years of struggle.",0
122018, It's possible that one of the reasons why the film wasn't nominated for a best-documentary Oscar was because it was too horrifying.,1
84682," In short, it's just not fun with the specter of tragedy looming over every scene.",0
235084, Redford and Freeman have a relaxed rapport -- watch their expressions when Griff asks them if they're gay -- but the script keeps giving them unspeakable lines to utter.,1

161419, By a wide margin the outstanding romantic comedy of 2009.,1
9830," The film, mirroring its anti-hero, settles on not being despicable by being just good enough.",1
249845," It's abhorrent, hilarious and destined for cult status.",1
59067," A well-intentioned study of depression, undone by pitching itself as both serious drama and whimsical comedy.",0

138942," We see the resilience of the adult Elián when he takes a swim near a Cuban beach: After all he's endured, he's not afraid of the water.",1
56470," A movie so flat and derivative that it seems to have been cobbled together from other, better pictures.",0

37274, Astute show business satire packs a darkly comic punch.,1

99376, Caine gives a gravely dynamic performance... but it's a role well within his usual range.,1

94484," This is pretty standard stuff, and it's not always rendered too convincingly.",0
56833, More careful viewers might be starting to question the validity of this ongoing story: a five-film-too-long journey that has never felt more arbitrarily plotted than in the final 10 minutes of Saw V.,0

68576, Turning Reese Witherspoon into a smug piece of salad is probably not the best use of all those millions of dollars.,0
88793," Far from your average monster debauchery or invasion extravaganza, District 9 operates as an allegory for apartheid, xenophobia, corporate malfeasance, gentrification, and the dog-eat-dog nature of living in poverty under hostile and oppressive conditions",1
101363," It's amusing enough, and certainly better than any of the schmaltzy holiday claptrap the studios clog up the multiplexes with this time of year.",1
23317, Roth's contemporary riff on the notorious 1974 thriller reaffirms its pulp fiction origins and puts the hardcore entertainment value back into the controversy of public paranoia over crime.,1

173295, This whole series has gotten out of hand ... ,0
205759," It's a mess, a complete and utter mess, but shockingly, the movie is rarely dull, embracing just enough of Duvall's dedication to realism to make it bearable. ",0
6806," Amalric doesn't tease out emotional ties between the narrative threads, which scuppers the faux-redemptive finale and results in a film of merely incidental pleasures.",1

49128," I'd love to understand why [Marianna Palka] wants to present herself this way, but I don't. It would be easy to call it self-loathing but that seems too obvious. Yet if there was another message, it's giving way to the self-loathing interpretation.",0

7862, Has a lot more stupid action -- and a lot less heart -- than the character-driven original.,0

80156," The people that populate this picture are refreshingly genuine and multifaceted, with understandable motives and tangible feelings.",1
112940, The script lacks wit. The danger of gift-wrapping the story in the pink gauze of a little girl's bedtime story tends to drain any sexiness right out of it. ,1
44558," The problem is that this being the third cinematic attempt at Spidey, it's been overdone and it doesn't help Raimi produced the very peak of it in 2004.",0
215039," Despite its heart being in the right place, I Do never does live up to its promise, thanks to melodramatic machinations and often preachy dialogue.",0
32266," Incompetent but relatively harmless. But unlike most projects bearing the name of producer Michael Bay, it never descends into pure nihilism. (Splice Today) ",0
22100," Obit is a fascinating, if slightly too long, look at newspaper journalism in general and obituaries in particular.",1

121592," Once you release the movie from the demand that it be significant, there are a number of achievements.",1
224981," There are moments when all this veers towards the so-bad-it's-good direction, but it never quite gets there. ",0
185208," Occasionally, the script ventures into territory that makes it seem like a different kind of fairy tale ... But the captivating performers are more than enough to give this Cinderella story a night at the ball.",1

46113, Whatever is achieved here visually is never really matched by a profound narrative.,0
239130," While consistently watchable, Yimou's movie is infused with a dirge-like tone...making it a somewhat wearisome and sluggish experience",1
57851," Intensely inhabited by Emily Beecham, it's a performance full of jangling discord and serrated edges, capturing a woman at the exact moment when circumstances magnify her already forcefully nihilistic personality.",1
10169, It's some of the darkest humor you'll see on the big screen this year.,1
1356, Trumped is simply too rushed - and too disinterested in actually stirring the pot - to add anything to the conversation.,0
150068," Physical comedy and accidental drug-taking are all well and good, but at this point, they're modern staples of the genre that Life of the Party does little to reinvent.",0
220399," Witherspoon is terrific - low-key and gritty as a woman who's lost her way and seeks to find it alone. Her voice-over narration is evocative, sometimes heartbreaking.",1

102921," That all-action ending is thrown away in a matter of minutes by a film that spends 100 minutes building to a climax that never happens, and makes a hash of telling a great story.",0
242127," Chastain is one of the main claims of the film, and she is up to the demands with a role in which she shows as much energy as subtlety, but the most remarkable thing is the script. [Full review in Spanish]",1
195224," Belladonna stands as both an important forebear to a now widely beloved genre, and as a confused, yet earnest tribute to those who dare defy authority in order to elevate themselves.",1

69144, 12 Years a Slave is an outstanding triumph in filmmaking since it's so unbelievably captivating yet will leave you feeling so undeniably uncomfortable as it takes pride in ripping your mortality to shreds over the course of two hours.,1
208370," So intent on shoving its ""magical"" quality down your throat that it becomes rather annoying after a while.",0

93887," The late detour to Lagos is also poignant and adds another emotional layer to Femi's heritage, and... there is a complexity and a profound investigation that is often missing in similar stories of teen angst - and for that he should be commended.",1
65818," Better than anything Burton has made in years, but it is never completely what a good story should be: compulsively entertaining.",1
21700," Cheekily bizarre, sly and audacious if imperfect. Some of (director Randy) Moore's critiques are clearer than others and he tends to over-emphasize the sexual innuendo.",1

103918, Few things could be sadder than this unfunny vehicle for a clown long past his prime.,0

58331, This is easily the worst filmed version of anything penned by the prolific author.,0

161555," Offers little to separate it from the likes of Mad Max, The Road, or numerous others mining the same ground.",0
82112," Like its lead Royalty Hightower, whose performance is just as spectacular as her name, The Fits is impossible to look away from. It's gorgeous, poetic, and opaque, and I've never seen any other movie like it.",1

48251," It is full of political insights, of ironic humor. It shows an understanding of words that mean nothing. What the script lacks is definition of people as people. It stacks its deck. McKay is too charming, too nice, his rival too much a villain.",0

99084," Overstuffed and clumsy, nothing makes sense.",0
69045," Equal parts coming-of-age story and slow-burn thriller, writer-director Megan Griffiths' quietly absorbing and methodically disquieting drama is a genuine rarity: a sympathetic portrait of a budding sociopath.",1
176163," Among the CGI monsterfests of the holiday film season, this quiet, humorous drama of oppositional wills from different generations coming to terms with each other is one of the miracles of the season.",1
51869," Violence can be used for various purposes, good, ill, and incoherent. This would be the primary observation made by V for Vendetta.",0
154207," ""I don't like this whole thing,"" Sondra moans. ""I don't like the whole process."" That makes two of us. ",0
168007, A dark fantasy shimmering with the dusty luster of the past...Suspiria holds a whispered decree: believe women. But also: don't underestimate them.,1
35173," Writer/director Ron Shelton is that rare beast: someone who can make movies with wit, warmth and perception about American sports.",1
73411," a watchable, but otherwise unremarkable flick.",0
237018," Touching The Void takes us to both heaven and hell, and knowing the final result only serves to increase our sense of awe at the achievement.",1
124553, The material is so far removed from what it originally was ... that the stretch has made it shapeless.,0
159421," The fragmented plot, as it were, certainly comes together in the end -- but that doesn't make it any less of a mess. ",0
157193," The film is as soulless as Agent 47 is, conforming to all the mediocre-thriller cliches (the action zips from Salzburg to Berlin to Singapore for next to no coherent reason) with little originality.",0
230856," Ma appears to have been written, shot, and cut with the words ""visceral"" and ""surreal"" hammering every corner of Rowlson-Hall's directorial reach.",0
84345," Not an easy picture to endure, as Weir carefully examines every last step and troubled breath...A film that develops after viewing, taking time to sink in as fates are reconsidered and brave motivations are appreciated.",1
48341, Imitation Girl is an interesting character study focusing on women asking the questions: Who am I? and What do I have to show for my life? ,1
93942, I'm glad that von Trier is continuing his self-examination. But I don't think I want to hear from him again until he's had an actual breakthrough.,0
157393," The movie today projects the story's theme through a prism of even timelier contemporary woes of failed banks, corporate fat cats and the general feeling that the ""green"" is being squeezed out of most everyone left and right.",1
196397, The failure of world conscience haunts The Devil Came on Horseback.,1
114603, Might best be thought of as a female version Hoop Dreams.,1

124803, Bland and uninspired.,0
33664," Unusual, uncomfortable, austere, and tragic, this drama film will likely give you the bitterest taste you've had this year in the movie theaters.",1
113378," ""Avengers: Infinity War"" isn't just a gussied-up mediocrity being widely mistaken for a good movie. It's also, at least arguably, a dangerous movie for anyone who cares about the future of American cinema.",0
195165," The Elephant Queen is so kid-friendly it feels neutered... The documentary is without a doubt charming, but it is also too innocuous for its subject matter.",0
129479," It's unflinching in showing what happens and how it happens, but the whys of the culture elude it.",0
44424," It's as visually proficient as a calculating, multi-million dollar, live action studio offering should be. And yet, the end result is strangely tentative and a bit soulless.",0
147067," The odd vivid shot reminds you of Rodriguez's dynamic visual imagination, but also what it's wasted on here: a project as indifferent as some of the trash that inspired it.",0

24913, It's official: Katherine Heigl will not rest until every last person on Earth is a misogynist.,0

136783," Made-to-order for the singer-actress's target audience, preteen girls and their obliging moms.",0
166972," ""Jinn"" is certainly not lacking in audacity, but its uneasy balance between inspired delirium and mundane genre dues-paying is its one bridge too far.",0
3195, A charming look at the world of Calvin and Hobbes.,1
189213," While Helen Mirren elevates the material with her usual aplomb and the events being depicted inevitably are stirring, this is a stodgy crusade-for-justice drama, directed and written with minimal flair.",0
208760," Smart writing, moving performances and of course a lovely soundtrack coalesce into an intimate cinematic gem.",1
11245, Several stalwarts of European cinema retread familiar territory in this light-as-a-feather upstairs/downstairs comedy set in 1960s Paris.,1
22987," The Powerpuff Girls takes place in a similar vein, although its message is a little more rockum sockum, it still it has style and wit to spare, and a message of empowerment for bad little monkeys everywhere.",1
42004, This is unquestionably terrible. But it's also rather fun.,0
21113," All this is more amusing in theory than practice, partly because Leonard's world of wiseguys and slapstick violence has become so familiar - the caper-movie default mode.",0
44071," Perhaps overly keen to emulate his hero's turn in Raging Bull, Gyllenhaal puts too much faith in the idea that size matters.",0
102626, This politically-minded ensemble drama's obvious attempts at being Traffic or Crash barely gets out of the garage before it stalls in neutral.,0

48118," This film is, as they say, close but no cigar.",0
7600," War is brutalising, infantilising, dehumanising, requiring the unquestioning submission to authority. All soldiers are child soldiers: that is the bitterly cynical nightmare that Sauvaire's film insists upon to the very end.",1
168712, Weiner is a tabula rasa doc - one of the most provocative of its kind I've seen. Everyone's bound to have a different perspective.,1
79579," Turbo accomplishes what it sets out to do -- it will entertain kids, and it won't make parents feel ripped off.",1
177360, The pity is that there's an interesting thriller buried inside this concept.,0
156704," The movie's only fresh element is the wintry setting, which shrouds everything in a mood of weary fatalism. Otherwise, it's the same old, same old, efficiently discharged and utterly disposable.",0

172475," Without intending to sound flippant, there is much to titillate in this delicately drawn tale about the origins of the vibrator as the world's most popular sex toy",1
203860," Memoirs brandishes old-school razzle dazzle at the expense of subtlety and contemplation, coating his sound stage sets in delicately applied layers of cherry blossoms and snowflakes.",0
200924," ""Infamous""' powerhouse casting doesn't add much, since most of the big names -- Sigourney Weaver, Gwyneth Paltrow, Isabella Rossellini, Hope Davis, Juliet Stevenson, and director Peter Bogdanovich -- serve as little more than window dressing.",0
92562," The film takes a downturn when, of all people, Leslie Nielsen enters the picture as President Harris. Slapstick had been well utilized up to this point, but it becomes incessant with quickly diminishing returns.",1
52296," More geared to celebrity-spotting than cinematic storytelling, it's fluffy and flimsy.",0
141396, This humour coupled with the film's dazzling technical accomplishments give it lasting value beyond its unique 'live' aspect.,1
243032, Sandler and his frat-house friends have done the infant-in-an-adult-body shtick to death!,0
2785, Combines the plot of HBO's True Blood with the intensity level of Saved by the Bell.,0

124238, Unbelievably funny!,1
215158," Margaret Brown's documentary, The Great Unknown, does what so many excellent documentaries does: It educates and infuriates.",1
23513," It's all competent enough, and the climactic scenes play out in a pretty exciting way, but don't expect anything innovative here.",0
15597, This tentative questioning of the sometimes unscrupulous methods and deleterious consequences of political correctness is further undermined by Ted's insipid character and general indifference to his fate.,0
161143," This material badly wants to be searing and disturbing, but it's all too obviously conceived as showboat material for actors, with little room for subtlety.",0
162613," A return to form...the acting was really good, surprisingly from the Klansmen.",1
218817," The film is randy and rough-hewn even by the standards of its genre. I could claim to have found it tasteless and mirthless, but that would be a lie.",1
225976," Woody Allen does it again: one more unfunny, terrifically out-of-touch comedy set in an almost unrecognizable upper-class New York, pristine and shiny.",0
29132," The trouble with I Served the King of England is that it's sometimes bizarre and clever and often visually wonderful, but you never forget that you're watching a movie. And it does go on.",0
223845," The movie not only shows you the longing felt by its characters, it draws you in to sharing those feelings with them. You want them to find their steps and rhythm. ",1
189876," ... packs a powerful emotional punch thanks to its sensitive treatment of emotive themes and an incredible, multi-layered performance from Sarah Snook.",1
171117," A blood-drenched portrayal of what has been called ""the peculiar institution,"" an epic work that indicts our freedom-loving nation.",1
28274," It's dark, depressing and pretty questionable as a family film.",0
220466, Taapsee is growing as an actor with each film and is a delight to watch as a bahu.,1
223434," 12 Strong passes by doggedly and in a haze, a theatre of war which gives us back row seats rather than throwing us properly into the thick of things.",0
217218," If you really don't ask for anything more than a solid hour or so of giant creatures beating on each other, well then, this new ""Godzilla"" is for you - just the way all the old ones were.",1
174671," The approach is depressingly literal, and none of the scenes build on what has come before -- they're just meticulously reconstructed Scenes From Watchmen.",0
44915, Edgar Wright has little time for genre restrictions. Baby Driver is a unique and engaging presentation that avoids obvious comparisons.,1
68564, Remarkably uneventful and rarely compelling.,0
190379," Every Day plays it rather safe and sanitised, with no sex or edge, and no real desire to probe the potential complexities of its strangely creepy scenario.",0
33643," Transcendence can only muster a sloppy, dull, inept watch that refuses to present a single exciting idea about man's inevitable technological self-destruction - despite Wally Pfister's eye for visual beauty.",0
32958," One of the best movies of the year so far -- a riveting, white-knuckle thriller to rank with the best of Hitchcock, and an examination of the morality of drone warfare to rank with the polemical plays of George Bernard Shaw.",1
156744," Room demands not just to be seen, but felt-and the feelings echo long after you've left the theater. This is destined to be one of the year's best and most celebrated films.",1
9264, Tomboy captures a delicate moment in time before issues of sexuality so much more complicated and calculated.,1
184758," You'll admire the doggie tricks and tolerate the rest, which is both the best and worst thing that can be said about it.",1
169606, it really is a nice and cheerful film that comes as a welcome respite to most of the other multiplex behemoths and a good portion of the reason why it works is because of its innate sincerity and pleasantness. ,1
110187, The film bears a closer resemblance to a shooter video game than an actual movie.,0
230882," Rather than create a haunting nightmarish history from which we may be unable to awake from today, the use of [the] anachronistic trope in 'Never Let Me Go' only de-empathizes the audience from the film's bigger and brighter ideas.",0
33827," BREAKING IN is a silly, but enjoyable excursion...",1
241220," All of this could only have come from the warped imagination of Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, here making his singularly strange English-language debut.",1

20332, See this film. It takes you to a place you won't soon forget.,1
91719," A bit disjointed but also vibrant and loving, much like its subject.",1
31110, The story's dour flatness keeps it from being as disturbing as it aims to be.,0
63648," Borrows tropes from the rom-com playbook, and has enough laughs to be mistaken for one, but ultimately doesn't want to be pigeonholed.",1
88504, A wonderful and brutally engrossing dramedy about family and the lasting effects of growing up in dysfunctional households.,1
107543," The most spine-tingling exorcist flick since, well, since The Exorcist! ",1
93875," The story of Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler is, as Hollande said, an inspiring one that deserved to be told. It's a story, though, that deserved to be told better than Eastwood manages to do.",0
36463," Heaven Knows What is a disorienting, often brutal, haunting film, as emotionally naked and deeply empathetic a portrait of addiction as modern cinema has seen.",1
45391," The latest stomach-knotter from Denis Villeneuve, a specialist in feel-bad cinema.",1
159691," If critics and fanboys weren't suckers for simplistic nihilism and high-pressure marketing, Afterlife would be universally acclaimed as a visionary feat, superior to Inception and Avatar on every level.",1
140459, This movie never gets started.,0
7071," A film of a very self-conscious aestheticism, and at the same time seems to be naturally prolonging the substrate of its cinematographic discourse. [Full review in Spanish]",1
141641," ""Peppermint"" is a belabored exercise in lazily constructed déjà vu, without the grit or stylized ham of predecessors it so baldly steals from.",0
154485," I'm So Excited is a throwback to the director's earlier, goofier films, but it doesn't work nearly as well as it should.",0
91981, If the movie has a still point inside it-an unassailable conclusion-it's that justice and the law are not the same thing.,1
90605, An intoxicating dose of children's entertainment of the rarest and weirdest and most delirious kind. ,1
225819," Breathe is at heart a wholesomely pretty prestige picture, not wont to truly sting or provoke.",0
200515," Let's describe Neil Burger's latest as director ""Abraham Polonsky's 'The Matrix.'"" It's a hyper-local amped-up Manhattan melodrama that pulses through one man's mind, one user's bloodstream. ",1
133593," If you want a graduate degree in the history of hip-hop fashion, look elsewhere; if you're looking for an entry level course, Fresh Dressed is a great primer.",1
52577," If you're up for The Forbidden Room, it fulfills it's oneiric promise by leaving you with the vague impression that you dreamed it - and dreamed its dreams within dreams - even if you know you didn't.",1
195827," If you're prepared to sit through two and a half hours of noisy cack to see a grand total of three decent special effects sequences, then I can heartily recommend it.",0
154382," You don't have to be a schoolyard bully to find yourself longing to administer swift, vicious wedgies to the nerdish inhabitants of this kitsch Kiwi excursion.",0
49081, Touch the Sound is remarkable not only because of Glennie's story -- a clinically deaf Grammy-winning musician who has played with the world's great orchestras -- but for the way Riedelsheimer uses sound.,1
161886, Big budget films that are actually about something are so rare this one's worth checking out just for novelty value alone.,1
170392, It is pretty and worth watching for the visuals alone but I just can't figure out why Coppola made choices that seemed to neuter her gothic thriller?,0
159568," Although this is drastically different compared to the rest of Godard's oeuvre, it has without a doubt had a lasting impact with its ground-breaking visuals.",1
190301," Alfredson is merely interested in repeating the highlights, recreating the best moments of the book but also the worst, resulting in a film that hits with precision as often as it seems to drag endlessly.",0
244344," Byrne walks away with the film by making Kelly a well-rounded, conflicted person, rather than the film's fun cop who has to tell everyone the boring truth. ",1
202849," Unfunny and relies too heavily on lame gross out gags and vulgar dialogue. Big gimmick is seeing the original cast all back together, but the last time we checked, no one was signing petitions to get them all in the same room.",0
81028, Mosquitoes bite. Gators tear. But only Victor Crowley strangles a man with his own intestines until his head explodes. ,1
77785, The charm of this picture is the way it captures the world of manners of turn-of-20th century London with captivating performances by Zellweger and McGregor.,1
82090, Sometimes it amounts to a laugh or two.,0
32285, Julia Ducournau exhibits a clinical pitilessness that's reminiscent of the body-horror films of David Cronenberg.,1
149635," Filho never explicitly addresses the psychology of either character, staying in observational, in-the-moment mode instead of providing any kind of emotional insight or backstory.",0
60162," The baseball sequences are fabulous, not least because Costner looks and moves like a real player a rarity for actors in sports movies... But the love story, a five-year off-and-on affair, is little more than a sop to Costner's romantic faithful.",0
39782," Of all the movies culminating in a rite of exorcism, Romanian writer-director Cristian Mungiu's remarkable ""Beyond the Hills"" stands alone.",1
194788," Honestly, it's hard to see why ""Jimmy P."" was ever made.",0
77675," Stillborn and not even remotely scary, this update of the Halloween series (which rewrites the series as if the third through sixth films never happened) is just another excuse to make some bucks with Curtis screaming her head off. Zzzzzzz.",0
26638," The background of the film directed by Jorge Ramírez-Suárez, starring Juan Manuel Bernal, suffers from dramatic exacerbations and manipulative music.",0
138423," Gibson is only 60 years old, a few years younger than Liam Neeson, and so could conceivably continue appearing in action movies like this for years to come. He clearly has the knack for it.",1
155323, The movie benefits from an air of earnest goodwill and well-turned performances.,1
48005," This intriguing and skillfully wrought indie science-fiction tale has the feel of a low-key ""Black Mirror"" episode.",1

19513," Bright and chippy as a roomful of parrots, and the best thing Saldanha has done since the first Ice Age.",1
122896, The Last Picture Show is indeed one of the greatest movies ever made (although I hardly think the scorekeepers were waiting for my vote to come in before they declared it such).,1
129032, CGI spectacle that smacks of self-importance and showbiz hustle P.T. Barnum style.,0
205711, Undigestible fusion of worst-case earth science and leaden pacing.,0
78078," Doesn't leave you in a dream, specifically the dream of Linklater's previous films, so much as it traps you in an endless bull session.",0
36743," Apparently Besson became so enamored of CG animation's possibilities that he forgot basic rules ... such as the one about animation thriving on clear-cut, distinctive characters whose personalities are established in the first few seconds they're on screen.",0
179624, Mild but talky look at Churchill's early days in power. ,1
48594," The brothers have created a character who's hard to love and a bit of a chore to invest in for an hour and 45 minutes. Like the old songs in his repertoire, he's familiar, not new, but he quickly gets old and tiresome.",0
63978, The strength of the film comes from the intensely intimate focus it keeps on Agu who is formidably played by young Attah.,1
46368," Maybe they could show Let's Be Cops to prisoners doing life in Attica, or would that be cruel and unusual punishment?",0
73996," While pretending to avoid controversy, debut director Peter Landesman continually steps out of bounds.",0

32090, Brigsby Bear is so committed to its brand of self-congratulatory uplift that the filmmakers refuse to contemplate any of their material's darker aspects.,0
113368, Barbra Streisand has the show-stopping moments in this uneven comedy.,1
134360," A riveting look at the day-to-day life of a U.S. army bomb-disposal unit stationed in Baghdad, this is the kind of emotionally charged drama that's traditionally released in the fall. Not that you won't be grateful to see it now.",1
20084," Waters writes warmth into his caricatures, lifting Hairspray above cartoon cult.",1
95072," The problem is that [the] movie barely meets the minimum generic requirements, and thus comes off as pretentious for presuming to hover so airily above them.",0
188768," The sentiments are real without succumbing to exaggerated sentimentality, thanks in large part to that big lovable lug, J.K. Simmons.",1

28907," A similarly rousing and savvy adventure that energetically serves up more of what we love and yet wisely, wittily, reverses the first film's accommodating traditionalism to make for an even richer, funnier portrait of its tight and in-tights family.",1
70992," This latest gentle, sensitive, unhurried tale from Studio Ghibli...excels not only at natural beauty, touched with supernatural flourishes, but also at acute psychological perceptiveness...",1
7323, You know you're in a fantasy movie when the central character has to traverse time in search of the 'Monkey King.' If only you were in a good movie.,0
102066," Although it is inoffensive and well-intentioned, The Holiday is neither the sum of its parts nor an especially effective whole.",0
10422," Wooden, yes, and saccharine, too. Oh, and did I mention the neutered whimsy?",0
29620, Too much time is dedicated to both bad jokes and funny jokes that are allowed to overstay their welcome and ultimately implode.,0
2571, I'll just say this: The Big Lebowksi is an excellent movie - and damn funny.,1
169434," Part two is more a straight-ahead action flick, substituting brawn and brawling for the pastoral radiance of the first film.",1
175753," The new movie has been handsomely shot and produced, but the raw punch produced by Christie in her extended climax is missing.",0
194142, A sharp study of corporate greed for those who felt Michael Moore pulled too many punches.,1

70112," He's not remaking Death Wish. He's making what he thinks a person in 1974, sitting in a Forty-Deuce grindhouse theater, would have seen in their mind while watching it ...",0
143541," It was so visceral and inherently theatrical off Broadway that at first I thought it was a terrible mistake to commit it to film. But, in one of those rare unforseeable happy endings...",1
126322," The stories are uninvolving, often too brief, and they quickly grow tiresome and repetitive.",0
18365," It's lurid and overblown, relying on its lionhearted heroine never to play her most obvious escape card, but for those with a taste for such silliness, it makes for a harrowing night at the movies.",1
234956," The movie is good fantasy action fun, made by people who really care and know what they're doing.",1
228133," We may look back on Anderson's works as we do on the boxes of Joseph Cornell -- formal troves of frippery, studded with nostalgic private jokes, that lodge inexplicably in the heart. In Moonrise Kingdom, that lodging is already under way.",1

114279," A very big, exceedingly dumb thrill ride. Live your life a movie at a time; for 136 minutes, you'll be free.",1
245140," The remake illustrates only how low modern action movies can stoop. Necks are broken, guts eviscerated. Fans of impaling and decapitation will not be disappointed.",0
110889," Remains effectively squirmy, gruesome, and even prescient nearly forty years after its release.",1
153581," The director, who shares writing credits with Parveez Sheikh, succeeds at setting up an intriguing if convoluted premise, but then struggles to take his characters and story anywhere interesting. ",0

73518, This rigorous beautiful black-and-white drama of early-'60s Poland is an art film in the best sense.,1
156631," Said to be intended as a reflection on shifts in Turkish history and identity, it is too diffuse and withholding to add up to a cogent result.",0

164067," The shocker ending struck me as both gimmicky and ill motivated, but up until then this confirms von Trier as the cinema's most accomplished provocateur, turning his attention here to the eternal conflict between pleasure and morality",1

49637, The movie's so hung up (pardon) on its gimmick it never transcends it.,0
47026," That it is superficial is a given. It's clear that Refn's plan is to drug us into transcendence, into the eerie plains of his Norse parable Valhalla Rising. He wants this film to levitate, but it doesn't.",0

245893," Not only a sad farewell to a great band, but to life as Murphy knows it.",1
161030," Many kids will enjoy this traditionally animated story, but parents may find it overlong even at a running time of less than 90 minutes.",0

40861, [Babis] Makridis employs several bold devices in the service of this scalding character study; the most striking of which is the use of droll intertitles which give an insight into a mind which is happiest being sad,1
240925," It's mush all right, but it's not whether something is mush that matters, it's how well it's done. And this is very well-prepared mush - purified cornball, if you will - served up with a terrific central performance by James Corden.",1

41886," One flaw in Nicolaj Arcel's film is that it's too short and compressed to make anything lucid of its cockamamie mythology. At the same time, it's such a leaden piece of work that you wouldn't want it to be it any longer.",0

214530," This is a humane movie, one that's looking to prompt empathy and introspection most of all. On those terms, Moonlight is one of the year's most gripping viewing experiences.",1

51759, It effectively pinpoints how denial can be institutionalized over long periods of time.,1

220637," Penguins of Madagascar aims primarily for the kiddies, racing from one frenetic action sequence to another like some haywire Walter Lantz cartoon.",0
50148, It's a pantomime. And not the good kind where you can unironically enjoy the campy theatrics.,0
14894, These characters have become too smart for their own good. The never-ending banter between Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law gets tired quickly.,0
151657, The concept was there; the production abilities were there. It's the execution that fell apart.,0
241002," There's bleak realism behind the comedy, Cruttenden's twitchy performance suggesting that power games in this household are nothing new. The final scenes, anarchic and glorious, will not easily be forgotten.",1
245635," ... brandishes a confident style and attitude, managing broad-based appeal that transcends cultural backgrounds and musical tastes.",1
115338, Nichols succeeds in spinning an entertaining yarn.,1
135641," The film does a great job of showing how hard it is to chip away at such steadfast beliefs that people hold, all the while showing that there is good at the human core.",1
246262," Best. Panda. Ever. A threequel that beats the standard with fight, fun and loads of heart. ",1
215995," [W]hile it has a handful of solid laughs, just as many of the film's gags fall flat.",0
225502," Sisterhood furthers an honest dialogue among young women, for whom life roads are not always clearly paved. It's definitely not The Baby-Sitters Club -- and that's a good thing.",1
38180," Forges a pretty bulletproof family film from what from what I, at least, feared would be a worn-out formula.",1
88173," It's pretty regular in terms of plot and story - the kind of thing we've seen many times before, though usually with less likable actors and without all the dirty jokes.",1

214614," Outstanding '70s concert docu has smoking, drinking. ",1
213409," Battle of the Sexes is a film that needs to wrap together several concerns into its overarching feminist manifesto and it just didn't have the time to deal with everything properly. Consequently, it feels like some steps were skipped over.",1
184230, The character as written is so pretentious and self-destructive that it's difficult for the audience to connect with his story.,0
123602, The film takes a matter that every American with an ounce of decency should be concerned with and handles it so poorly that the Dick Cheneys of the world will have no trouble dismissing those who take it seriously.,0
200780, The pun-fueled dialogue is a perfect match for the visual ugliness.,0
87766, Asking what it all means is laughably irrelevant and Weerasethakul's Cemetery of Splendour teeters occasionally on the ephemeral even as its subject is the ephemeral nature of reality.,1
231482," First-time filmmaker Xavier Legrand based this harrowing chronicle on extensive interviews with those on the frontlines of domestic abuse, and he communicates his findings with great sensitivity and withering insight.",1
177314, Despite being overpraised - it arrives garlanded with the kind of reviews that must have come out after the opening night of King Lear - this is still very effective entertainment.,1
38827, Godard seems almost giddy in his use of 3-D.,1
162439, Garver's film also works as a great overview of the sweeping changes in both filmmaking and film culture over the course of her career from the perspective of someone in and yet not of the industry.,1

157635," In addition to being a gloriously bittersweet and entertaining story with great music, it's an important film.",1
228899," Whatever director Argyris Papadimitropoulos and his co-writer, Syllas Tzoumerkas, had in mind, a full rethink was in order.",0
92575," It's Julianne Moore, more than any cast member, who's the reason to see Gloria Bell. Moore, and that fuzzy disco soundtrack, which keeps her dancing, and which will make you want to join in.",1
203355," Warner Bros.' low-budget stab at capturing an urban niche audience is higher on stylistic dazzle than originality or coherence, making it an unlikely candidate to bust out of the box office ghetto.",0
150826," It's not nearly as funny as its premise would suggest, and the movie even becomes a little dull when it tries to make a few points about the differences between commercialism and art.",0
16386, [A] condescending exercise in you-go-girl uplift,0
111589," Shorter than a bad blind date and as sour as a vinegar Popsicle, ""Young Adult"" shrouds its brilliant, brave and breathtakingly cynical heart in the superficial blandness of commercial comedy.",1
220455," A sunny, high-style, beautifully verbose romp.",1
93803," The Good Night takes familiar (embarrassingly familiar) male-angst material and makes it go loop-de-loop, so that the jokes hit you from behind and underneath while the bleakness smacks you in the face.",1
149715," Enchanted is worth seeing for Adams, and children will adore the slapstick performers, including a prominently featured CGI chipmunk.",1
246757," The film has a good concept but lacks the vibrancy and spirit of the city it is set in. Overall, it faces 'connectivity' issues.",0
122895, A superbly guilty pleasure for a rainy day.,1
55454," It gets to you. It's too long but the final scene is a quiet stunner. In its final minute, Arnold ends her film by proving to you in a virtuosic way just how you've come to care about her heroine Star.",1
212703," Most of this film is a joy. It's Plain Jane compared to some, but its deadpan wit and poker-faced comic naturalism come to seem the ideal to which all Austen cinema should aspire.",1

159279," A textbook example of ye olde two-joke movie -- and beneath those two jokes, there's precious little else to fall back on. ",0

125913," After a powerful opening scene and reasonably strong first act, the pic slowly leaks air.",0
182080," It's a series of ""Boo!"" moments that add up to less and less as director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. piles on more and more of them.",0
59752, The film's lack of originality goes beyond its title as it tediously imitates fixed-camera observational indie dramas while privileging dialogue that plays like uninspired improvisation.,0
240575," A dramatically solid if stylistically conventional drama about the effects of false accusation of child abuse on an innocent man, well played by Mads (the villain in Casino Royale) Mikkelsen.",1
131412," It's all fast-paced nonsense, easy to take but not quite engaging enough to warrant a night out at the movies. Yeah, best to wait for that DVD.",0
181696, You can't write off The Notebook as just another tearjerker because the characters are brought to life in such elegant fashion.,1
87488, Kristen Wiig out-weirds herself as a self-obsessed talk show host.,1
96474," This is an honest film above all else. It doesn't excuse Mapplethorpe's transgressions, but it manages to celebrate his work in spite of them. ",1
142084," By the time the movie ends, we don't even know very much more about these two than we did when we started: that they're a pair of privileged, great-looking people with a photogenic case of the oh-so-sads.",0
192257, CTRL+ALT+DEL this nonsense and find a film that knows how to treat you respectfully.,0
127981," While Akira's blood splattering is over the top for me, I did enjoy the surreal, and the interesting complicated departure from the often-oversimplified good vs. evil.",0
145055, It's hard to account for the curious emptiness of The Nanny Diaries.,0
217915, Sometimes-edgy shorts collection captures Big Apple's verve.,1
36600," I think there are a number of small strong moments in the film, but taken as a whole, it feels like a muddle.",0
167388," A picture that's genuinely funny in spots. Unfortunately, it dissolves into the kind of sitcom silliness that would probably have you reaching for the remote if you were at home.",0
85700," Nihilistic, imaginative and emotionally gratifying, The Dark Knight is in many ways a groundbreaking triumph, and perhaps the best superhero film to date.",1
181216," Impressively directed and superbly written, this is an emotionally engaging, deservedly Oscar-nominated drama with a terrific central performance from Mohamed Saïd Fellag.",1

81600, A must for political junkies and anyone interested in the inner workings of the way we elect presidents.,1
117258," Sophomoric doesn't begin to describe the humor (most of the characters are freshmen after all), but you may find some laughs in spite of yourself.",0

219913," This is one fine neo-noir, expertly directed by Ridley Scott with a host of superlative star turns, and an arresting, challenging screenplay by Cormac McCarthy ",1
180243, May just be the most quintessential Steven Spielberg movie Steven Spielberg never made.,1
228697," ( ... ) pretentious at times. But if you fancy a Thai-flavoured cross between David Lynch and Chan-wook Park's Korean movie Oldboy, expect to be drinking the atmosphere.",1

108733," well made, but empty inside",0

136411," While Men is not as energetic or bracing as God, it is a disturbing exploration of violent drug culture in Rio's shantytowns. It's also a poignant look at the legacies of fathers who abdicate their responsibilities.",1
17967," Liam Neeson is the granddaddy of action films. The Oscar winner's stoic, deep-voiced, monotone, but - most importantly - likable demeanor is consistently entertaining. You want him to win and he always does. ",1
212400," Faxon and Rash are more than competent behind the camera and the film flows smoothly, easily mixing laughter with tears without being heavy handed. I wouldn't be surprised to see it on Oscar's short list next year.",1
210958," While these films have been flooding the market, you've got to hand it to uber-producer Kevin Feige whose grand design comes into sharper and sharper focus.",1
206497," Herzog appears to have no serious intent in his new documentary Encounters at the End of the World. Instead, the film seems only one more step on Herzog's path to living oddity.",0
222384, It might hold some appeal if you're as teenager with a thing for dirt bikes.,0
78544," There's no suspense, not a single jump-out-of-your-seat moment",0
222661," There's almost no plot, and loads of schmaltz, but the hidden metaphors and cast chemistry makes this a worthwhile effort.",1
166737," Basically a three-hour montage, Cloud Atlas neutralizes involvement in its dovetailing dramas by treating every character as a point in some quasi-spiritual game of connect-the-dots.",0
72605," The Tribe revels in the distance it leaves between its audience and its characters, but in placing viewers on the outside, it also creates an experience that's almost perversely empathetic.",1
95185, The LEGO Ninjago Movie is almost as fun and irreverent as the previous installments in this click-together build-a-world of corporate animation.,1
10063, It represents a particularly limiting application of hard-bitten manly values to experiences that can't help but transcend them.,0

79666," For all its absurdities (and there are plenty), as a chest beating, hi-octane romp, From Paris With Love is as enlivening and gratifying as they come.",1
128817," It's definitely not an easy film to watch, though, since it's so unflinching in its portrayal of incest and, if possible, is even more unsettling in the way it exposes dirty little secrets without trying to make its characters sympathetic.",1

64988," Intelligent and uncompromising, with knock-out performances from Downey Jr. and Foxx.",1
202841," Leaving aside the complex issue of assisted dying, one of the film's biggest problems is how much Me Before You shields the audience. For a supposed romance, it's surprisingly prudish.",0
900," This timely Quebecois drama can sometimes creep too far into afterschool special territory, but the intense emotions on display give it a certain raw staying power.",1
4012, ...a rare film of conflict without villains.,1
119202, Unbreakable is at once flagrantly absurd and stubbornly mournful.,0
105204," Marnie is the character study of a thief and a liar, but what makes her tick remains clouded even after a climax reckoned to be shocking but somewhat missing its point.",0
5061," Wong's languid direction will not be to everyone's taste, but the acting is impeccable and the film looks staggering, a perfectly sumptuous waking dream.",1

250334, Julia Salmeron as the protagonist of this documentary is what maintains the audience glued to the screen thanks to her charisma. [Full Review in Spanish],1
239187," Somewhere, buried in The Five-Year Engagement, is a sparkling screwball comedy fighting against a turntable running on long play.",1
93226, This absorbing chronicle of a hijacking in the Indian Ocean has the strengths of the best procedural dramas -- it assumes a distanced and objective tone and packs an emotional wallop.,1
3584," Audiences that find themselves laughing at first will likely be fidgeting as the pic drifts toward a peculiar if oddly predictable climax, requiring -- much like the Stepford women -- that brains be checked at the door.",0
229424," Glassland smartly plays off Jean's unhinged disintegration against John's tense, subdued control. In that contrast lies the power of this film.",1
26643," The whole enterprise is surprisingly painless, albeit in an icy-cool, numbed-out way.",1
147694," Though always meant to be a fairy tale, this new ""Annie"" comes across as especially materialistic and shallow, an endless parade of high-priced trinkets and fancy clothes.",0

10817, The Killer Inside Me may be the darkest film noir ever made.,1
106392, This is essentially a haunted-house horror flick that starts off with effectively eerie scenes but devolves into a forced and mildly ridiculous ghost story.,0

76513, This Disney movie isn't a follow-up to the first Pirates of the Caribbean so much as its empty-calorie clone.,0
210837," A waste of Stallone's talent and star power, not to mention 94 minutes of your time.",0

230698," As creepy-doll flicks go, The Boy isn't the worst I've ever seen. That honour would probably go to 2007's Dead Silence. ",0
239739, This presentation of two artists pursuing passion without concern for social or marital rules becomes a well-groomed melodrama that deflates interest by closely guarding the feelings of those involved.,0

102650," The point of [Ferguson's] film seems to be that even though the invasion was unnecessary and wrong, it still could have turned out much better than it has, and he tries to pinpoint key errors during the first weeks and months after March 2003.",1
7020," Yeah, it's not good.",0
211125," Crowe is still a master navigator of swampy territory, and any movie that can warm the heart and tickle the funny bone without selling its soul is to be cherished, warts and all.",1

145653," Everything you need to know about this film is contained in its most self-consciously bravura sequence, an extended, single-take home invasion that's at once accomplished, self-impressed, sadistic, and redundant.",0
41863," Elvis is clearly used as a metaphor by Jarecki. Undeniably progressive in his approach and his politics, the filmmaker still crafts a compelling portrait that reaches beyond simply ideology.",1
166560, Limp financial cyber thriller has lots of strong language. ,0
159544, The places feel lived in. The story feels like life.,1
131749," There are a half-dozen hilarious scenes, the Barden Bellas' new nemesis is awesomely weird, and you could hardly find a more endearing group of college students played by 30-year-old actresses.",1

27942," [Smith's] brash, over-the-top persona practically dissolves.",1
86926, There's no questioning the director's ability to wring moving moments from potentially sentimental and decidedly familiar material: the story of penniless immigrants trying to make it in Manhattan. It got to me.,1
236308," Wasikowska has that magnetic creep that pulls us to her, but the film is afflicted by the arthouse syndrome: it renounces its pulp roots and wishes to appear high-brow -- a pretension it can't sustain.",0
194023," There's nothing splashy to see here, just an awkward evening with two extremely interesting people. Thanks to the assured direction of Marston and the nuanced performances of Weisz and Shannon, that's more than enough to warrant a look.",1
151021," ... even with its brief imperfections, these are two days you'll want to watch over and over again.",1
201421, A mass of indecipherable symbols combined with obvious self-indulgence on the part of a writer-director-star Alexandro Jodorowsky make what could have been an entertaining western into one of the more pretentious films ever made.,0
204828," I suspect that you'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it. If you go, pack your knitting needles.",0
51340, The usually great Piccoli-saddled with a ridiculously contrived failed-actor backstory-comes off like an unholy mix of Gérard Depardieu and Robin Williams at their sad-puppiest.,0
181891," The whole thing feels rote, like a previously unconnected, generic thriller screenplay that was rewritten to be part of the Lisbeth universe.",0
89991," I think Edward Cullen has Asperger's syndrome... Bella should totally go for Jacob instead, but then he could do way better with any of the townies... Edward looks lame ripping trees out of the ground and jumping around the forest like Tom Cruise on Oprah",0
135185," [Jason Reitman] has taken himself far too seriously, producing a film so ruminative and honeyed and dull that the final scenes start to resemble a terrifying and treacly recurring dream, in which no one seems to be able to leave town.",0
43343," If the film overall never quite works up a full head of steam, it still has enough to recommend it for viewing on a lazy summer's day. ",1
14689," There are a lot of little smiles in The Addams Family, and many chuckles and grins, but they don't add up to much.",0
81358," With the secret behind his formidable skills out of the bag, all we have is a good guy who is good at things, and a sense of obligation to conjure up a convoluted syndicate of straw men for him to chop down.",0
226297, Morfydd Clark [is] excellent as Dickens's wife.,1
151335," A mesmerizing, beautiful and terrifying documentary that can stand among the greatest war movies ever made.",1
23934," It's like one of Ingrid Bergman's screwier films, or a John Hughes Breakfast Club-like setup if you're into more contemporary references.",1
104549, A particularly risible nothing whose premise alone betrays the paucity of Franco's imagination and wit.,0
23896," Some weapons, peril in engaging fairy tale adventure. ",1
244968," Trash--grubby and nonsensical, with lame dialogue, wretched overacting and clumsily staged action sequences.",0
212774," Uncompromising, exceptionally bleak and shot through with dark humour, this is an extraordinary piece of work that shows Wheatley at the very top of his game.",1
201231," You can't go wrong with an uplifting, anti-war story like this, but director Christian Carion trowels on the schmaltz.",0
68315, The movie sadly runs aground on old gags that no amount of eye-popping color and frenzied action can spin into gold.,0
74171," Be patient. Arrival falls just short of perfect thanks to an expositional hiccup midway through the film and a climax that hinges on a borderline-hokey revelation, but the end will more than justify these ever so slightly sloppy means.",1
171174," Thanks to tight direction by Brian Goodman and lively performances from Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, the film's engaging even when it's ridiculous.",1
211946, Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno.,0
134927," Scott has directed a phenomenal film --- one that will be a real crowd-pleaser. It's impossible for it not to be --- the adventure is intense, frightening and coming so close to being a reality.",1
164947," 'Overkill is underrated,' proclaims a character in The A-Team, which might as well serve as this stylish action film's motto, selling point and chief limitation. ",1
140616, Elvis Presley's 1963 Rolls-Royce serves as a metaphor for what 's wrong with this country in two-time Sundance Grand Jury winner Eugene Jarecki's new documentary.,1
65985," Rather than trying to entertain us, director Tom Six goes all out in an attempt to make us sick, to offend our very sensibilities. He has succeeded. And screw him for that. ",0
52192," It's another of Baumbach's outstanding odes to family being both the catalyst for, and saviour from, the ""slings"" and ""arrows"" of life's ""outrageous fortune"".",1
164493," Decent special effects aside, the thriller -- about a killer fog that rolls into a Maine community and traps terrified townsfolk in a grocery store as it unleashes a menagerie of otherworldly predators -- is less horrific than it is horribly didactic.",0
18530," [Bettie] Page's most striking feature, aside from her obvious beauty, is her humility: she truly doesn't get why people think she's so great. But you will after watching this riveting film.",1
77486, A reverential but uninvolving adaptation of Maurice Sendak's classic illustrated book for children.,0

31065, Highly suspenseful yet full of conventional ideas,1
240518, A long and complex film (five and a half hours) that seems to go by in a series of vivid flashes. ,1
183801, As the drama unfolds the ludicrousness of J Mills Goodloe and Will Fetters's script intensifies and the dramatic punches are more liable to provoke howls of laughter than tears of sadness.,0
79461," ... offers a raw yet sincere portrait of adolescence, with a firm grasp on its characters and setting.",0
166063, Hogwarts instructors behave suspiciously (as usual). Kids spy on secret meetings ... break rules for the greater good (as usual). It all leads to a wizard showdown (as usual).,0

65230, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 answers questions posed by the first movie by exploring its cast of colorful miscreants in a way that almost makes it an anti-blockbuster.,1
248946," Williams, lambent as ever, ably conveys the tension between Monroe's eyelid-fluttering public persona and the damaged woman behind it.",1
171023," Blackly funny at times, it looks terrific - but basically goes to show that life's a b---h. And then you die.",1
114339, There's a problem when you make a film so dark that Hotel Rwanda looks like a crowd-pleaser -- especially when the story asks filmgoers to leave their reasoning skills at home.,0
31525," Modest in scope, but barely puts a foot wrong.",1
7469," As Chazelle oscillates between documenting NASA's many missteps and peering behind the curtain of the Armstrongs' domestic lives, he conjures the type of cinematic high any filmgoer has been chasing since they first stepped inside a theatre.",1
152555," The film ranks among the greatest crowd pleasers in cinema history, an achievement it will surely hold for a long time.",1
98358," It seems like this premise could get into some creative and maybe even subversive territory, but it mostly sticks to the basics.",0
19579," As a Revenge of the Nerds redux, Superbad isn't perfect. But it's super close.",1
192627," Clearly aimed at a tween audience, this purported feline comedy is far from purr-fect.",0
38472," Awe-inspiring and, by far, the best Superman movie ever made.",1
61344," PPZ is an interesting concept, in that it takes what is often viewed as stuffy ""chick lit"" and gives it something for modern audiences to identify with. It's just not enough.",0
22221," It's closer to the hammering ""Transformers"" aesthetic than expected. Yet the weirdness around the edges saves it from impersonality.",1
117668," Superhero stories aren't just about fighting, but the examination of self. When Aquaman remembers this, it's a sight to behold.",1
100285, It has no particular voice. It's too clotted with plot and strategy.,0
138035, Untraceable essentially forces its audience to identify with those who would be willing accomplices to torture and murder.,0

247238, Mile 22 tries hard to bring a new hero to the action film genre but it ends up getting in its own way too much to be really enjoyable. ,0
42883," This is a terrific film, arguably one of the best spy movies ever made.",1

159178," The film poses questions, leaving the answers for us to figure out. But one thing is for certain, the most compelling part of Captain Fantastic is the skipper himself.",1
197315, The hypocritical misogyny of He Got Game is a fundamental weakness that reviewers so far have been happy to downplay or even to dismiss.,0
98761, An exercise in dreary cynicism... It's hard to imagine a picture that's more of a wallow in corruption and nastiness than this.,0
215904," If there's a tray full of food within camera range, rest assured that somebody will knock it over. If a stuck-in-the-elevator-on-the-eve-of-an-important-event routine presents itself, rest assured that its staging will be tried and true.",0

41300, The lack-of-language barrier is the least of its problems. ,0
71555, That Steven Soderbergh is able to make a borderline-engaging flick out of such a flimsy story is a sign of his skill.,0
214557, This movie has one of the best scripts in many months.,1
772," It functions like a giant meat grinder, making hash of everything it depicts.",0
66000, offers plenty of things to talk about but perhaps the most remarkable part about it is its confidence of style and its sober-eyed sense of uplift,1
37520, The performances disappoint.,0
131416, There's not enough invention or material for 91 minutes of this and the only performance that feels particularly inspired here is Maya Rudolph who works her usual 'how-is-she-this-hilarious?' magic.,0
236112," Vaughn's mischievous imprint hangs over all: slick, irreverent and begging for more -- of what, I'm not sure.",1
91083, It's a familiar tale but one which feels fresh and fascinating. ,1
20430, McFarland USA has a distinction in that it's the rare sports movie directed by a woman. Caro's perspective is invaluable to the film's trajectory.,1
929," Thor: The Dark World is visually enticing, but in a more ominous way than in the first film. With extraordinary special effects, Thor: The Dark World is sure to be well-liked by those who loved the first film yet isn't nearly as well done.",1
62128," Like Cloverfield, Skyline unleashes rampaging beasties on the streets, only this time they've arrived in massive spaceships -- and they're here to collect human brains. It's a shame none of the Skyline protagonists seem to possess any.",0

189515," I don't believe for a minute that this is a woman who hasn't already come of age, found her voice, and talked a sensitive singer-songwriter into hiring her to star in his movie. ",0
164324, Burton and Depp again prove to be a marvelous combination in this gory yet glorious adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical. When was the last time you winced and became misty-eyed in the same movie?,1

181788," Makes for a pretty good summer action-adventure movie, if nothing else",0
192715," There is a nice mix of humour and pathos here. Barnyard may not be all that exceptional, but it is quite satisfying.",1

222932," Thoroughly entertaining and delightfully tuneful, this fun little film will have you singing to yourself for days afterwards.",1
63893," As a gymnastic movie, it almost works (think of it like a decent routine that's flawed by a hop on the landing).",0
108006, 'Suds in the Cyclone' might be a better title for this old-fashioned disaster movie...a 'Twister' on steroids that employs massive amounts of CGI imagery while ladling on soap opera cliches to add a 'human' element.,0
234375," Terence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave would be captivating reading the nutrition label on a bag of crisps, so it's no surprise that they elevate ""Unfinished Song""...",1
12072," Who knew there was this much fun left in glee clubs so long after ""Glee"" jumped the shark? ",1
179901, Likeable Owen Wilson sails blithely through a potentially brilliant comedy that crashes soon after comedic liftoff.,0
38940," The film has all the building blocks to be a great fantasy ride, and Diesel is clearly enthused to be a part of it. As it turns out, though, passion isn't everything. ",0
3886," Philip Seymour Hoffman disappears into the title role, yet the movie is fundamentally superfluous",0
180870," I get the fact that much of it is done with tongue firmly planted in cheek, but the problem is that this just isn't any fun. ",0
73007," It had moments of truth in it, but I didn't think that as a film it was particularly effective.",0
56389," Though it isn't vintage Pedro Almodóvar by any stretch, this sumptuous saga of love, loss, grief and guilt features enough touchstones to the unconventional Spanish director's previous repertoire to please his loyal cult.",1
243945," In its favor, I will grant that it is inoffensive: you could take your kids to it, which isn't true of most of Sandler's oeuvre. But really, your kids deserve better.",0
157995," Overexposed? Overly cute? And cuddly? Sure. Bottom line? Funny is funny, and these guys are hilarious. ",1
84521," Opulent but flat-footed, and loaded down with a series of top-forty style songs that sound like rejects from 'Frozen,' the movie insistently exhorts us to celebrate diversity while itself remaining obstinately commonplace.",0
82826," Love & Mercy is always interesting, but it's only occasionally illuminating. ",1
79537," Peter Hedges... benefits from having Julia Roberts, who still can simultaneously deliver charm and knife-edge suspense as if this were the second coming of Sleeping with the Enemy.",1
101942," Jeremy Dyson and Andy Nyman's remarkably ambiguous Ghost Stories is unconventional, structurally bonkers and bloody-freakin'-brilliant.",1
183657," The melodramatic, passionate ""Shirin"" story drives everything forward, and gazing at the faces of these amazing women can be a compelling experience in itself.",1
25318, The movie hits so many familiar beats that it's impossible not to see what's next. It does what you expect at almost every turn ...,0
94255, Gone is the lucid paranoia or the slow-burning mystery. Here we have a middling spy-thriller that only loosely acknowledges its roots; I'm sure Larsson will be turning in his grave.,0
73695," Instead of an insightful look at disaffected youths finding an outlet for angry energy in rock rages, American Hardcore is a slanted history lesson coming solely from its subjects.",0
13279," A film I expected to enter the ninth circle of the chirpy Hilary Duff 'girl-power' inferno is one of the sweetest, most thoughtful coming-of-age stories I've seen in years.",1

4399, We hope that somewhere amid the streamers and popping champagne corks director Marshall is making a resolution to stop making these movies.,0
174276, For a film like Hamlet 2 to work -- even the title is hilariously ridiculous -- it has to sell the absurdity completely. It does.,1
216401," The episodic character of the film, articulated in a succession of romantic conflicts, ends up diluting the potential of what, in the end, is no more (or less) than a serial. [Full review in Spanish]",0
78109," Marley aficionados will be astonished by the depth and breadth of the documentary, which portrays the musician known as Tuff Gong as both a fallible man and an untouchable legend.",1

94573, We waited 15 years for this??,0

144311, Certainly the work of a deeply serious and distinctive film-maker.,1
20947," The movie's carnival-barker hard sell is that it's after The Truth. It's really after an opening-weekend gross, of course. It's sporadically clever and chilling, but I'll be shocked if it endures as a Blair Witch-style horror vérité phenomenon.",0

168627," Having stripped away all but the bare necessities, having reduced the components to a car and a man - they make a classic error of overcompensation. Locke, it occurs, is quite the most garrulous exercise in minimalism I've witnessed in years.",0
65426," Director Joe Wright may not always be able to resist self-indulgence, but credit the filmmaker for tending to the story with a pace and tone that meld commerciality with an art-house mentality.",1
134844," The story is trite and uninteresting. And the humor is only occasionally funny, and that's largely because it's almost impossible not to be impressed by Tracey Ullman's manic energy.",0
58969, This episode is one of the more enjoyable action experiences this summer. It's certainly the best dressed.,1
232647," You enter braced for uncomfortable hilarity with touches of deadpan violence. In that respect, Lanthimos does not disappoint. ",1
67424, The problem is that the film is chockful of clichés and stymied by production design and CG effects that look as if the worst of the Star Wars series was being devoutly copied.,0
67128," An embarrassment for all concerned, this witless, odd-couple comedy slings separate but equal gibes at blacks and whites... and still manages to ridicule gays and Hispanics.",0
98267," Working in this film's favor is the aforementioned brisk pace and the taut editing. It somehow adds to the sense of desperation and urgency that the lead pair feels. Overall, a passable action potboiler.",1
21295, Mary Queen of Scots may span a few years of the queen's life but actress Saoirse Ronan delivers a commanding performance as Scottish royalty.,1
119440," A movie as elegant, spare and tantalizing as its subject. ",1
239516, I felt nothing for the characters which makes the premise of rooting for the misunderstood a moot point.,0

234857," Despite much talk of diversity and tradition, Mr. Levine has little fresh to say about gentrification issues or documentary storytelling.",0
149794," This fictionalized story is a thin disguise for David Bowie's bio, and it is a rip-off of the Citizen Kane way of telling a fictionalized biography.",0
185700," In the end, I wish Berenstein had devoted her filmmaking to two musicals instead of four, thus affording even more screen time to each show's creative process (the audition process, the choreography, early rehearsals and such).",0
17641, An Inconvenient Truth was short on how to make life better. It rushed through a list of 'what to do next' offerings in the film's last few minutes. Here is where The 11th Hour shines.,1
174613, The basic problem with the picture isn't that it's crude or offensive; it's merely flaccid and bland.,0
145806, Frost is as likeable as ever but it doesn't feel like much Latin passion went into the script. ,0
61755, Superhero-on-superhero collisions beyond the dreams of fanboy heaven.,1
246024," A sequel that, while it's not disappointing, it also doesn't have too many findings. [Full review in Spanish]",1
1069," Somehow it takes all the childhood wonder that Jurassic Park encapsulated so perfectly and forgets it, leaving behind the fossilizing bones of a behemoth that once ruled many years ago.",0
126403, If Jeff Bridges earns an overdue Oscar for Crazy Heart it won't be for any charitable reasons. It's arguably the best performance of his career.,1

50404," Ricci's Carolyn is entrenched so in her small worldview, so surrounded by sameness, that as she opens her heart to Pumpkin it's entirely believable.",1
23646, It's all anchored by a magnetic lead performance from Downton Abbey star Dan Stevens.,1
143843," Makes fitful attempts to contextualize the shooting within the broader murderous history of American racism, but ultimately is far more interested in expunging the director's own sense of inherited taint.",0
17196," Food for thought for anyone who digs on existential narrative and adult, mannered, stylized, well-acted character pieces.",1
236738, It can't be a coincidence that the movie's initials are 'B.S.',0
137029," It has sincerity, sensitivity and is often ravishing to look at but is let down by a chocolate box love story. Still, Crowe still might have a Braveheart/Dances With Wolves in him yet.",1
89085," Prometheus asks a big, loaded question, but teasingly leaves the answer for another mission...and another movie. ",1
13481," Like last year's Black Dynamite, Machete deftly walks the border between self-aware parody and legitimate exploitation entry.",1

215228," Cruising the streets of Manhattan, clocking in at a tight 90 minutes and set on a bike without brakes, this loose-limbed action-drama is a swift, sweaty ode to the city's subcultures and a punky descendant of '70s B-movies.",1

185472," The story that was so compelling on the page, about the disappearance of a teenage girl 40 years earlier, feels simplified and literal.",0
118789," A movie that's unflinchingly real, carried by standout performances and an almost viciously alive digital style.",1
167876," It's a feel-good movie in that sense, affirmative without being sentimental or exploitative. ",1
191661, The Amityville Horror is just another indication that the trail left by The Exorcist has now become too faint to be worth following.,0
30914, The lovely moments outweigh the bad ones by a meaningful margin.,1

215907, It is nearly impossible to watch Captain Fantastic as a dispassionate viewer - the questions it brings up about how to raise children and how to interact with the world at large are too important and too well displayed. ,1
180785," Transgender jokes, fat jokes (always James, happy to look stupid), homeliness jokes, mama's boy jokes -- the picture was made by people who like to put down people, and it was made for people who like to tease others or watch others be insulted.",0
242980," Cairo Time is not a chick flick. Of course, it will draw, as it should, femme auds, but the story is so well crafted, the acting so spot on and the locale so spellbinding, this beautifully crafted artwork is a little gem.",1
1540," Obviously not for everyone, in the same way that Park's films aren't. But if you've got a taste for this kind of brutal, in-your-face story-telling, Lee delivers.",1

29989, Visual and narrative punchlines strike flawlessly like the absurdist humor of a Bugs Bunny cartoon...,1
21196, An extraordinarily good-natured movie.,1
103133," A heartfelt retro flashback littered with pop-culture iconography and much slang, it focuses on the importance of friendship and loyalty rather than social standing. ",1
216859," Leads Michael Angarano and especially firecracker Juno Temple are the reason to keep watching, but even they cannot breathe life into a compelling concept stretched too thin.",0
58101, Tom Ford's directorial debut A Single Man is unspeakably gorgeous to behold. From the glorious cinematography to the impossibly beautiful actors and actresses; no frame is wasted on anything even close to ugliness.,1

74889," The stakes may be low, but the experience is authentic ...",1
50057," Historically accurate or not, the movie works as a seagoing adventure; and the performances by [Clark] Gable and Charles Laughton are terrific.",1

205408," [The cinematography] amplifies the sense of desolation, but the images are poetic and stirring rather than debilitating; the dramatic lighting gives the rundown buildings and abandoned construction sites an otherworldly look. ",1
46565," We laugh with these people not because they're absurd, but because they're so normal. Swanberg's made the rare film that feels exactly the way your friends do when they don't know you're watching them.",1
51709," [The 1976 version is] exactly the sort of movie that would be improved in the retelling, but there's one catch: You're not supposed to treat the original like holy writ.",0

199589," While it's a disappointment compared to a lot of other animated films, it's not entirely bad.",0
201478," Man of Steel is not a graceful movie, in form or subject. It is about things getting smashed. The finale is a month of Sept. 11ths. ",0

48307," I could think of a half dozen things that INTRUDERS almost says, but the film doesn't take the time to actually say any of them. ",0
87011," Slapdash and second rate in script, animation and musical score, The Princess and the Frog is as shrill, uninteresting and headache-inducing as the worst Saturday morning cartoon.",0
32395," Colossal is a profoundly weird film-weirder than the already strange synopsis would even imply. We need more films like this, and we need them in wide release. ",1

184157, Jonze and Eggers' approach to the book is both original and well-intentioned; it's clear that they take both Sendak and childhood seriously (though not as seriously as they take themselves). It's just too bad the end result isn't a better movie.,0
96728," That it ends up reinforcing the fictions instead of reframing or rethinking them is the movie's greatest disappointment, and even so, it seems trivial.",0
151471," Transcendence is fairly ridiculous, but some may prefer its grand, loopy ambition to the small-minded sameness of so many futuristic thrillers.",0

9461, It's about as manipulative a film has Steven Spielberg has ever made - a movie that's been custom-designed from the ground up to play a sad harp solo on the heartstrings; a story cynically told to invoke as many tears as possible.,0
50284," The bad news is that it lasts two hours 45 minutes, which is astonishingly bloated -- and unforgivable in a film that spends a long, ponderous hour getting started.",0
109252, The In Crowd is one of those obscure features that a distributor sneaks into the summer marketplace when no one is looking.,0
141539," The film hasn't any depth to speak of, but is consistently shrewd enough not to go totally obvious ways. And the audacity in casting Kathy Bates as the dotty fan pays considerable dividends.",1
124673, Sadistic: Gratuitous Vs. Arbitrary.,0

30490," This impressively original film plays with cliches, especially ones about how people act, and act out, in crises. Then it explodes those conventions with devastating consequences.",1
88497," The Loft is a tawdry, twisty little whodunit, populated by unpleasant people doing even more unpleasant things. ",0

85588," Unlike many recent superhero movies, Silver Surfer doesn't have a heavy, overblown quality. For the most part, it's light and playful (and short, clocking in at a brisk 90 minutes).",1

153431," For all its brave beginnings and real achievements -- its assault on western mythology, its discovery of a subversive sexual honesty in an unexpected locale -- Brokeback Mountain finally fails to fully engage our emotions.",0
23480," Finally, a deep, dark comedy that quietly tickles the intellectual, moral and situational funny bone without pandering to easy laughs or overdone bathroom humour ...",1
247788, The film has haircuts in lieu of characters. A bore through and through. Obliviate.,0
240379," Sober, often moving documentary [that] performs a service by reminding us of...the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster of 2010 and its continuing impact.",1
113478," The script is fatally stupid, most of the gags fall flat, the secondary characters add little, Hudson fails to make anything interesting out of the exasperated heroine, and the endless references to McConaughey's sexual prowess finally become revolting.",0
229999," This is the only animated film ever nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and you'll see why.",1
41105," A sensationally entertaining, visually stunning epic filled with enough thrilling and invigorating action sequences to compensate for its dull, less captivating dramatic scenes.",1
197439," It's impossible to produce anything worthwhile from this screenplay, which has ugly, twisted morals.",0
55224," It's a lot more dystopian than I thought it would be, at times reminiscent of something as nutty as Brazil.",1
24720," Pitch Perfect 2 is sweet, predictable story, but it's shored up by some hilarious and absurd action on the sidelines.",1
119299," The even-handed film is sympathetic to the Cuban revolution in its initial stages, then slowly swings around to reveal the 'skeleton of a dream' that the society has become.",1
152693," A lovely little film about family and community pride and friendship, one that pokes gentle fun at stereotypes while never forgetting the real people behind a seeming cliché.",1
47357," By god, this could have been great. Spectacular. A masterpiece. If only Quentin had decided to make an epic rather than an epic joke.",1
180918," THERE comes a time in every great movie-watching experience where a special little moment in the film makes you smile with purest joy. For me, in Ironclad, it was the bit where a guy tears another guy's arm off then beats him to death with it.",1
97770," Despite its shorter length, the film never feels unfulfilled or abbreviated. Its terrific performances, beautiful narrative, and haunting score... are so immersive that decades of life go by without it ever dragging.",1
160456, Fun for a spell but becomes repetitive and monotonous. It leaves you in a haze.,0
14745," What could have been an oasis of quiet, thought provoking nostalgia turns out to be an utter bore. Yes, it's family friendly but it's also entertainment exterminating.",0
175743," No one could fail to enjoy this movie, but it's the product of an art and an industry that went in different directions with the coming of sound, and popular English-speaking audiences never became accustomed to reading subtitles.",1
143390," Although there is some undeniable entertainment value here, the plot of Four Brothers ultimately proves to be pretty standard.",0

84863," One of this year's must-see films, this is not simply a worthy tribute of a subject too often ignored by Hollywood; it's also a remarkable piece of cinema in its own right.",1
159347," The film needed a little more oxygen to be perfect, but it still has great virtues. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
179148, Here's to hoping 'The First Purge' turns out to be the LAST 'Purge' -- But don't count on it.,0
217870, The Adderall Diaries comes across as an incomplete jumble of colliding plot lines.,0

192761," This sleek-looking but curiously unfocused character study never quite gets down to the business of showing us who Brandon is, but boy, does Fassbender make him into a captivating enigma.",0
208575," Part western, part war movie and part epic romance, Baz Luhrmann's latest extravaganza is cheesy and ridiculous on several levels but it's also surprisingly enjoyable and never boring, despite its lengthy running time.",1
147690," Still, for all its clever ideas, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle suffers greatly in its execution.",0
141259," Good Time, like so many other films of its ilk, revels in its ugly male characters. The Safdie brothers try to squeeze dark humor from these guys but also seem to have no awareness of how repulsive they've made their lead.",0
80267," It's really two movies, in which one is much better than the other. But that landing sequence is truly amazing (Splice Today) ",1
156578," Occasionally funny but more frequently excruciating and derivative, 21 & Over is aimed firmly at relative newcomers to the genre. Perhaps it should have been called 21 & Under.",0
162096," The Visitor is a tiny treasure of a movie. This is a wistful comedy that quickly finds its rhythm, but never lets that groove become a rut.",1
117899," The real screen stealer in Triple 9 is Clifton Collins Jr., as the quietly diabolical, dirty detective Rodriguez. He is a reason why this film will keep you glued to your seat.",1
186520," Filmed before the Swift boat veterans brouhaha, Paul Alexander's partisan documentary is effective filmmaking.",1
104630, Stoppard and Wright's version is rich with artifice,0
100889," The first 30 minutes of the film, where this concept is really milked to the max, easily makes for some of the funniest comedy of the year.",1
178167," You get the sleazy fatalism you pay for, albeit with production values and scare tactics more atmospheric, restrained and artistic than you might expect. ",0
190874, ...the initially impressive visuals are ultimately negated by the annoyance of the technology.,1

48262," Del Toro takes his time to get to the violence, but he never let go the audience and captures their attention with a magical and gothic aesthetic. [Full review in Spanish]",1
101521," Tolkien's inventive, episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle.",0
67974," Plaza and Duplass are enormously watchable, and there's a sweet sadness in the movie's focus on lost dreams and missed chances, and the truism that we all long for a time machine every once in a while.",1
212600," One thing I noticed early on when watching this film was how strongly it draws you into the story. It really hooks you, and as an example of investigative journalism, this is as good as it gets.",1
152183," Then you start to ask yourself, what is the point of all this?",0
121470," Confronted with such effects, the actors make not the slightest effort to appear terrified, amazed or sometimes even mildly concerned. Some might consider that a weakness. I suspect it is more of a deliberate choice, and I say I enjoyed it.",1
37636," An affectionate and rambling look at professionals trying to save a ship they believe is sinking, and the deck tilts every whichway. They don't know whether to jump or bail.",1

222765," This is not a cartoon for children, but a vision both beautiful and horrific of the promise and perils of art.",1

98139, At least the depressingly similar Transformers franchise serves up its soullessness with a side order of crazy. Real Steel just piles on the schmaltz.,0
178668, It's deeply insulting to movie audiences when an award-winning playwright thinks that this sub-Tarantino nonsense carries the essence of cinema in some way.,0

215607," Rich in texture and colour, music and aura.",1
77808," Its obsession with male genitalia, or, more specifically, penis receptacles, is emblematic of its overall aura of male entitlement and its consideration of women as prizes to be lanced.",0
142369, I would simply be remiss if I failed to point out the lowered stakes. The closest the film comes to acknowledging that anyone's life might truly be on the line is in the blankly understated face of Rylance's Abel.,0
35403," While it might not work as the scare-a-minute spookfest you think you're watching early on, it redeems itself as a grim, dramatic, emotionally charged tale.",1
4087, The unsung heroes who played on stacks of wax during the '60s pop era are celebrated in a hugely entertaining documentary.,1
239086, August Wilson's shattering Broadway drama gets a soulful interpretation.,1

222969," A vertiginous, nauseating, unscary mess of a film.",0
216483," Brigsby Bear, directed by Dave McCary and co-written by Kevin Costello and star Kyle Mooney, arrives in time to save the idea of the 'fan' from toxicity.",1
32713," Despite impressive visuals and voice work, this fourth instalment feels uninspired and unnecessary.",0
164871, Anderson proves himself a bold stylist with his dark and colorful tale of the rise and fall of a makeshift family of L.A. porno stars and auteurs.,1
26332, Beck directs a script so damaged it's a wonder that the Kriticos family and their annoying nanny (Rah Digga) don't escape through plot holes.,0

104380," The movie, as heroic as it may have been to produce, is more noteworthy for its intentions than its execution.",0
74872, One of the worst sequels I've ever seen.,0
44615," Anderson's looking at war, retribution, notions of nationality and nationalism, isolationism, culture and individualism. And he's doing it with stop-motion dogs. He's something else, one of a kind, and we're lucky to have him. Isle of Dogs is sublime. ",1
18755," The familiar zombie routine has never been realized on such an epic scale, but that is the film's only claim to novelty.",0
140737," Holds a handful of chilling scenes and unforgettable images, but its cumulative effect is one of disappointment and missed opportunities.",0
248726," Stale, insipid and silly...if you stay for the end-credit blooper outtakes, it becomes obvious from their banter that Fey and Carrell could have been far funnier if they'd improvised.",0
85690," Spectacle is as important a character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as its caped crusaders, and never before has this proved such a significant truth.",1
4301, familiarity only adds to the feeling that this is just another Carrey movie,0
44095, Righteous Kill is one of those excruciating trick movies that is proud of its pseudo-cleverness.,0
206978," That implacable moral balance, in which good eventually silences evil, is at the heart of the Western, and Eastwood is not shy about saying so.",1
250929," This is a film that doesn't want to be easily pegged, either in terms of its politics or generic allegiances. Such ambiguity is a virtue, but for all his technical facility, Hood doesn't really have the finesse of a great, fearless satirist.",1
110726," While Body Heat involves murder, fraud, a weak hero led astray and a seductive, double-dealing broad, it also incorporates something new: a sexual explicitness that the old films could only hint at.",1
25915," Everything falls apart completely at the final reveal, with a maddening twist cheapening the whole film immensely and rendering the story an even sillier exercise than it initially seems.",0

216663," I doubt even [Jen and Ben], popping in the DVD as if it were a home movie, would be able to detect any onscreen chemistry.",0
129030, Swedish director Daniel Alfredson pushes the caper button too many times. More sly wit would have helped things come to a head.,0
249149," That the film is arguably far too emotionally and psychologically bleak for its target audience would be excusable, even laudable, if it were better. ",0
94106," Director Matthew O'Callaghan supplies a bright, cheerful look that will please small kids, but parents hardly need rush them to the theater; the video will do just as well.",0

222220," I was hoping for more, but what it delivers is worth your time, and the butt kicking robot kid rules. ",1
58222," There's an eerie sense that Jackson is directing from beyond the grave, when not impersonating himself mimicking romance or lust on stage. While the title intimates a prophetic double meaning, as the chronicle of a singular life, and its abrupt farewell.",1
240662," Bio-pics always tailor memories. Yet the welcome surprise here is Kutcher, as the barefoot rebel who brought the spirit of psychedelia to technology.",1
73344," Mistaking leaden atmosphere for gravitas, Vromen turns what could have been a vibrant period drama (it runs from the 1950s through to Kuklinski's arrest in 1986) into a sludgy ordeal ...",0
6513," Part tastefully muted, part plain morose, Keaton's direction styles this as a character study of hearts in winter. But it doesn't wash.",0
223878," The whirl of hormones, high hopes and hysterical drama that is high school earns its close-up in American Teen, a smart and revealing look at the Class of 2006 in Warsaw, Indiana.",1
186929," Very rarely have I seen a film where the relationship is so convincing. Here Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams give performances that will bring you very, very close to your own memories and longings, because we are so very close to theirs.",1
220443, Perhaps some stories are just too big to be told in an hour and three quarters.,0
47851, [The] characters don't mean anything because they don't say anything or do anything that feels rooted in the nitty-gritty of the everyday.,0
68357, Lacks the bite and the fright of the original,0
153309, These are all great actors with great characters but they're stuck in a film that can't get its tone right.,0
249921," Told in a breezy, fast-cut style, and backed by a boisterous soundtrack that ranges from Puccini to James Brown, Lifetime focuses on the players -- on the field and off -- that made the Cosmos such a super, if short-lived, team.",1
80843, Blame this mess on Travolta.,0
235600," This is a sharp and, at only 80 minutes, tightly-made debut. The script is strong with some nice little hints and nods, so you can put the pieces of the wider story together.",1
237060," A gentle, unhurried drama about how people can connect with each other through conversation, nonverbal gestures, and writing.",1
244420, ...[A] moping melodramatic malaise. Ridiculously artificial in its Cupid-driven cornucopia of sketchy endearment. [Rodanthe] has the forceful flair of an unlit wax candle.,0
3913, A stylish tour de force. [Full review in Spanish],1
222796," There's comedy in the notion of a character played by Robert DeNiro being asked to talk about GoodFellas at a small-town film society meeting in France. Unfortunately, there's not 110 minutes of comedy in it.",0
136707," Côté's eerie fantasy drama juxtaposes the mundane and the parochial with the supernatural, to sometimes disquieting effect.",1
14841," What a life, beset by tragedy and illuminated by brilliance, and [director Stevan] Riley does it proud.",1
172599," It's cine-spirit not too far from Strictly Ballroom, Kinky Boots is a well crafted comedy that wears a solid pair of dramatic shoes to take us down the road to an entertainment with something to say.",1
141435, The effect is more numbing than humorous or horrifying.,0
144765," Whatever else is true of the movie, the cast is having fun, and Anna Kendrick gives phenomenal reaction shots.",0
77467, Director Tucker's virtuosity is in marrying Blake's memories to the present and finding they are one.,1
68061," Big, loud, shamelessly corny, and full of unapologetic sound of fury.",1
119989," Although Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan lack erotic chemistry, this fetishistic fantasy remains faithful to the provocative novel.",0

180464," Frankly, the story isn't remotely as interesting as Cage. Nothing is.",1
22123," The jokes begin to repeat themselves, and the plot becomes mired in unintelligible details of the white-collar crime that Gamble and Hoitz are investigating.",0
193855," Yet David Fairhead and Ant Palmer's film never feels like pre-Brexit tub-thumping, and that's mainly due to the diversity and vitality of their interviewees.",1
141979, The movie is incredible and you will likely agree with me once you see it.,1
203985, There really isn't anything terribly fresh nor distinctive here.,0
203672, The nymphs and druids who frolic through The Romance of Astrea and Celadon occupy mythological space between Shakespeare and Greek mythology.,1

145137, ...ultimately fits comfortably within the pantheon of above-average body-switching comedies.,1
207657, It's an uneven affair but fans of the style will find it comedy nirvanha.,1
62847," Casting Gary Oldman as Churchill seems like a risky gamble, given that both are known commodities. But Oldman, who has already portrayed such disparate figures as Sid Vicious, Lee Harvey Oswald and Ludwig van Beethoven, proves to be up to the task.",1
218810," The Internship is harmless but fails to deliver laughs worthy of ""Googliness."" Instead, it's more akin to Yahoo! - a functional Plan B when nothing better is available.",0
27832, Self-congratulatory doesn't begin to describe it. Delusional might.,0
111284," Aimed at adults more than kids, this animated feature is only intermittently funny, skewering sibling rivalry.",0
77218," An intelligent, incisive documentary that illustrates how events in that small town in 1944 still matter today, The Rape Of Recy Taylor deserves a wide audience.",1
234255," If Km.0 is long on logistics, it's short on logic.",0
196042," An enjoyable, nostalgic, and even a bit touching time at the movies.",1
55172," Debut director Matthijs van Heijningen's update of the previously twice-made ""Thing"" horror movies is a completely respectable effort in spite of everything you've heard or read otherwise. ",1
177738, It's not scary because not one second is believable.,0
98281," The film may as well be titled ""Stephenie Meyer's Waiting Around.""",0

23571," By the end, the sad, preposterous emptiness of the court has overtaken the movie and turned it from a potentially intriguing drama into a forlorn, muzzy daydream.",0
231493, This is just a lot of chomp-chomp-chomp and point tallies wafting upward whenever something game-oriented is blown up.,0
133250," The auditions are hilarious -- we know how important song choice is in these competitions, and they've been cleverly matched to a wide range of wannabe animals.",1
135304," This drama of pain and loss felt by parents whose children die young may be the best of its kind I've seen since ""Ordinary People"" long ago.",1
5506, Priest could never live up to its geek cool promise,0
100878, What the film cries out for most is a quality supporting player. Where are Dwight Schrute and Tracy Jordan when you need them?,0
117371, Left Behind is a generic plane crash into oblivion with Nicolas Cage at the wheel that attempts to shove its heartwarming ideals down your throat. ,0
29632," The first ten minutes of the film are basically just Chen Zhen single-handedly defeating the Germans and winning the war, and it's so jaw-droppingly good that it almost makes the rest of the movie feel like a let-down.",1
227847," The plot takes forever to get rolling, and the movie is hamstrung by numerous tourism sequences (from the Forbidden City to the Great Wall) facilitated by the state-run China Film Group.",0
12614," If Spielberg had commissioned Jane Austen to write the screenplay for Amistad, Belle is pretty much what we would have gotten. It's a sumptuous period piece reflecting on 18th-century social mores: rank, revenue, and-in this case-race. ",1
80638, Teen-appealing heist movie has a few brutal fight scenes.,1
153842," Darren Aronofsky's Noah was the most exciting big-budget studio film of 2014. While comic book movies are all the rage, Aronofsky's Noah treats the great flood as the ultimate origin story: the origin of life as we know it. ",1
203875," Told in a tight 81 minutes, the well-structured adventure tale is stronger than the soft, pastel colored computer animation.",1
73236, Brody made me understand his character's torment but more in a clinical way than in an emotional one. Polanski needed just a bit more depth in his protagonist.,1
205350," What's onscreen is often more noteworthy for the particular atmosphere, mood and language rather than any particular role the characters or events might be playing in moving the overall narrative forward.",1
177797," At its most effective, the movie is a chastening, sobering, and thorough work of film journalism, however shortsighted.",1
241678, Maybe the theme is that you should try to score some of that stuff Shyamalan must be smoking.,1
10828," It's...the best kind of sequel, one that lets the surviving characters continue their journeys while new characters get to kind of rehash the original's plot with different results. ",1
87668," The deliberately lackadaisical, almost improvisational approach occasionally achieves striking moments, but mostly seems more flat and redundant.",0
213137," The sensory overload and thematic bludgeoning reach a point of deadening, diminishing returns.",0
43004," The scenery looks nice and she and Arnaud try hard to make it all appear less dopey than it actually is, but the end result is fairly laboured and forgettable.",0
173797, ... impressive work by Sofia Gala... [Full review in Spanish],1
199096," By making Statham a regretful lawman, it neutralizes his main talent, effectively neutering him. It also telegraphs the kind of mostly watered-down movie we're about to see.",0
103418," A story both grounded and ascendent, a movie that puts your emotions in orbit.",1
193217," Not only does it resurrect a nearly defunct sub-genre, but it succeeds far more than it has any right to.",1
110259," It works phenomenally well, leaving you thoroughly engaged rather than shaking in your boots.",1

227437," Mesmerizing, breathtaking and quietly poignant with a delicate blend of drama and comic relief.",1
127380," While this romanticized horror/fantasy tale is not exactly a classic redefining of the vampire mythology, it's not awful. In fact, it's better than the trailers suggest.",1
177917," The problem isn't the performers, but the waste of potentially interesting aspects",0
223020, Elisa y Marcelia from Spanish director Isabel Coixet will leave audiences underwhelmed.,0
207030, You couldn't say that Before I Go to Sleep isn't entertaining. But you couldn't say it was remotely plausible or logical either,1
207854," Surya is successful in making Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts a story that can happen anywhere, thus making the heart of the story one of universal appeal. The film is quiet but it flows.",1
86125," Given the pedigree of the cast... it's such a shame that The Conspirator is, for the most part, a run-of-the-mill courtroom drama.",0
234678," [It] taps into a glorious cinematic history, joining the ranks of films like Dr. Strangelove, Network, Fight Club, and Being John Malkovich as satirical touchstones that define an era of American history.",1
118917," The action is so rivetingly orchestrated, the crazed chaos of it so palpable, that the movie sucks you in.",1
56487," If scenes of extreme gore being played for dark laughs disturb you, you sure ain't the target audience here.",1
220677," In a great film, Kore-eda's thesis would be the starting point, not its culmination... But in the end, Kore-eda, for all the cooked-up moments in Shoplifters, knows where the heart of his story is. ",1
65028, The strange action plays out with a dreamlike lucidity reminiscent of late Luis Buñuel... It's also dreamlike in its handling of time; the film takes place over a few years but feels as if it transpires over a few days.,1
135253," It constantly teeters on the brink of falling apart, but it's held together by the sheer will of its talented cast, all of whom seem to relish the opportunity to get a little goofy.",1
92557," A much darker, French version of He Said, She Said with several pinches of Fatal Attraction caught between its aspirations and execution.",0
243442," A film with a great cast where the absolute star of the show, never better said, is James Cagney. [Full review in Spanish]",1
54314," It's a really, really unsatisfactory film, which is a shame because the story is quite an extraordinary one.",0
172404," I give this movie's costars and creators credit for making a ""message movie"" as palatable and entertaining as Promised Land.",0
219529, A charming entertainment.,1

207803, There isn't a genuinely frightening or interesting moment here.,0
39843, The very long development of the premise arrives at a conclusion almost opposite of the initial set up. [Full Review in Spanish] ,0
10308," Denzel Washington is a reliable actor, giving a commanding performance, but it's hard to see why this actioner was a hot property on a list of unproduced spec scripts.",0
186788," Chomko simply observes that life moves on, and we attempt to stay attached to the people we can as it does. ",1
2801," The idea to cast Hedlund and Hunnam as brothers is downright brilliant - if Boyd Holbrook were in this film, it'd be like looking at triplets.",1
201697, An absolutely hilarious performance fine-tuned to perfection by producer John Malkovich is worth the price of admission alone...,0
74998, A common criticism of blockbusters these days is a perceived lack of wit or invention -- the sense that big budgets and special effects are often used to paper over fundamental cracks. Baby Driver is an antidote to that feeling.,1
197931," An antediluvian portrayal of male midlife crisis, reducing any imaginable extramarital complication to a crass matter of gender warfare.",0
228716, Minor Abbas Kiarostami is still a reason for celebration. ,1
110799," Sci-fi fans will also recognize this plot from ""Pitch Black"" and ""Red Planet,"" both of which are superior to this film.",0
91309," Will Disney go on making live-action movies from its classic feature cartoons? If so, it needs a reason and strategy, not just a budget and back catalogue.",1
252000," [Dominik's] major misstep is grafting this story to modern politics (specifically, the 2008 Wall Street bailout) with a heavy-handed analogy that equates the dumb hoodlums to greedy hedge-fund operators.",1
162710," Watts is alternately annoying, sympathetic and hilarious in the title role. She's always entertaining.",1
247875," I don't know what kids this movie thinks it's for, but they're going to be screwed up.",0
248794," Visually dull and flat out ugly, Hercules apes the stylization of Zack Snyder's 300 to a troubling degree. It looks and feels cheap from start to finish, with nary a color to be seen.",0
156466," If you have absolutely nothing else to do, and you can see it for free, with little hassle, you just might get Fockersized.",0
44937," If anything, Stone has more grist for his muckraking mill now than he did 23 years ago. So why does the result feel so bland?",1
160347," Director X nods to the original movie but also smartly insists on finding more within its violently pursued ""American Dream"" narrative.",1
24110," Just as disappointing as Whit Stillman's Last Days of Disco, Marc Christopher's 54 suffers from a formulaic script that feels like a reworking of Saturday Night Fever and Boogie Nights, both superior and more entertaining pictures.",0
34524," What's wrong with The Predator goes deeper than a couple of bad cuts, but it still stinks that a promising movie was scuttled by a director's questionable decision-making - both on set and in post.",0
172288, 'The Adventures of TinTin' is a good old-fashioned adventure painted in modern colors.,1
99040," It's a story of one young man's tragedy, a story that resonates with so many other tragedies. Oscar Grant wasn't some mere symbol; this film makes him flesh and, unfortunately, blood.",1
234785, Salt is less fun than it sounds.,0
24145," As far as entertainment goes, Rogue Nation is second only to the original Mission: Impossible.",1
124841, A compelling drama that might have worked even better without the action-thriller shadings. The unknown actors are pitch-perfect.,1
16741," ---- there are all kinds of unexplained phenomena in the world, so who's to say that there can't be some sort of time warp where two people, years apart, can actually communicate with each other?",1
30720, The most personal and accomplished of the several documentaries Weber has made over the years.,1
78897, Girls memorize the lines! But it's not a 'Rocky Horror' type cultural event; it's a lukewarm soft-core-porn soap opera-basically 'Pretty Woman' with spanking.,0
7992, The Martian delivers on both intergalactic spectacle and feet-in-the-soil character drama.,1
58511," A dagger-sharp satire, a film filled end-to-end with tiny sticks of dynamite, each lit carefully with a gleeful smirk.",1
119098," Rio offers the uncomfortable spectacle of 10 different filmmakers mostly failing to produce a sense of place that can be sustained over 10 minutes, much less multiple senses of place that can be stitched into an interesting patchwork.",0
20774, An Academy-award caliber performance by Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher the Prime Minister revealing how her refusal to compromise trashed a nation and increased the gap between the rich and the poor.,1

236272," There's a streak of dark, wry humor in Benjamin Font's debut as a director, but its (small) wins are due to its concept and the lead performance from Charlene deGuzman.",1
82171, Bill Murray is Bill Murray is Bill Murray in a comedy that's little more than a schtick delivery system with some third-act personal growth thrown in for good measure. ,0
100251," Like ""Eat Pray Love,"" minus the abject loathsomeness. Standout work by Witherspoon, though",1
111658, Buffalo Boys ends up somewhat awkwardly caught between mainstream glorifications of violence and more restrained cultural norms emphasizing respect and harmony. This inherent creative conflict however remains mostly obscured by the action-oriented plot...,1
41791, Did Get on Up (which was disappointing as well) only depict the later years when James Brown faced personal and professional problems? No. It showed him getting on up.,0
221502," All of the men in the movie are fairly one-dimensional. Which you could say is a bit of payback, since this is a movie about and by women.",1
37970, Felicity Jones will break your heart at least once ,1
72021, Put the puppet back into the dumpster.,0
116239," The movie plays its role in movie history, becoming one of the great box-office performers in the pre-Steven Spielberg and George Lucas days.",1
68110," The dialogue and plot twists are tritely predictable, the musical score underlines syrupy sentiment, and the math on the generations depicted doesn't quite add up.",0
110026," In Instinct, the back-to-nature business takes on a misanthropic tone and a nasty malignancy.",0
142304," Nothing is duller or more stifling, as a rule, than people who wish to make it perfectly plain how stifled they feel by their dull suburban existence.",0
248618," Bleak as hell yet stubbornly optimistic, this low budget knockout is the best picture of the year so far.",1
242964," This is still Godard's view of life in France in 1964, and one of his most sociological films, as well as one of his most formally accomplished.",1
138920, Easily the best in the series since the original and a genuine spectacle with set-pieces that will knock even the most jaded viewers for a loop or two.,1
193844, A mediocre remake of a 1980s horror movie of the same name which wasn't that good to begin with.,0

18633, Hector and Ricky build an uneasy and finally heartwarming camaraderie.,1

156549," Most horror movies adhere to genre conventions, subvert them or spoof them. Producer Joss Whedon and director Drew Goddard, who wrote the screenplay together, do all three at top speed.",1
208180," Soorma ensures that this triumphal journey of the human spirit is full of surprises. The checklist remains in place, but this saga of heartbreak and heroism also has undeniable heart.",1
189174," The greater your capacity for the sentimentality factor, the quicker it will cling to your heartstrings. For the less inclined, it's an interesting primer on your values and options when you're facing mortality.",1
199208," While ""Silencio"" could be fascinating sci-fi, it's bogged down in all the family drama.",0
148022," The genuine heart behind the film from beginning to end earns the turn from the silly to sentimental, and elicits genuine feeling to go with all the fun.",1
140097," I'll See You in My Dreams may not be ""about"" much, but nonetheless, it has a lot to say and, like its characters, says it with precision.",1
85644, The movie gives the viewer a taste of the nomadic existence for those lucky enough to be part of a traveling circus. It also touches upon the vernacular unique to circus folk...,1
113704, ...reveals what's simultaneously so alluring and frustrating about Stewart's performances.,1
71066, ...a misguided endeavor that's often far too self-referential for its own good...,0
79643," We get an effective combination of raw, in-your-face direction - Friedkin has a ""two takes only"" rule - and a finely honed script.",1
22349, Armando Iannucci pulls off a balancing act that's more remarkable the more you think about it: this is a movie that's both mercilessly grim and uproariously funny.,1

177649," Andini brings the twins' exploits to life with the requisite visual and tonal balance: crisp and naturalistic, yet also ethereal.",1
138195," Something of a throwback to the Harrison Ford thrillers of the 90s, this is an average thriller with the occasional fun moment. ",0
86656," A recommendable film, especially for those who like real stories about real criminals. [Full review in Spanish]",1
64958," Seth MacFarlane's comedic modus operandi is to shock with outrageousness and pander with TV and movie citations via one non sequitur after another, a strategy that leads to a few laughs but nothing approaching lasting humor.",0
245380, Black Mother is a film about love made with love.,1
11500," An unusual documentary about a young man who has been a good steward of his childhood suffering and pain, creating out of it something that may prove to be helpful to others.",1
225858, I don't hate Alice Through the Looking Glass. I don't even question why it exists ... I'm just kind of saddened that this is what's deemed acceptable.,0
5163," Its characters are poorly-developed, the plot is the pinnacle of absurdity, and the acting, at best, is well over-the-top. Nevertheless, on the most basic, visceral level, the film succeeds.",1
180353, One might wonder whether this isn't the movie most calculated to enrage an audience ever made.,0
77118," Allen's Roman sojourn results in little more than a series of fanciful vignettes, occasionally insightful and not without the odd chuckle, but mostly just rather silly and inconsequential.",0
136386, The late jazz great is honored with a terrific tribute concert and a respectful documentary.,1
145232," ""Thor: The Dark World"" spreads enough of the love to co-stars, set designers and special effects personnel to make us forget that the hero is just a glorified quarterback from somebody else's favorite team.",1
184390, Doesn't quite make the leap from stage to screen with all its power,0
41843," Malcolm is an amalgam of many things, and so is Dope, although neither is a cliché.",1
181906," It's a film that should further the genuine sense of excitement surrounding this particular franchise revival, while standing as something of a classic in its own right.",1
99455, Reitman delivers a robust and occasionally flashy film. I'm just not quite sure it manages to get it all across.,1
130212," ...while Bello and Sheen hit all the varied notes, Ku fails to make the film's actual template - that of a school shooter's family in the days and weeks following the crime - believable in any way.",1
246291, Family fun adventure with an occasional wink to the adults. Who doesn't love Puss in Boots? Even Guillermo del Toro got in on this!,1

106024, Director Marcus Nispel continues in Pathfinder the gory/lame tradition he began with his Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake.,0
56688, A wonderfully told modern vampire tale set in the inner city. The film features strong performances and stunning cinematography by Sung Rae Cho. The ending left me reeling.,1
207604," The usual Emmerich-style approach to 'Stonewall' would have been dodgy, maybe even offensive, but so is this one",0
89442," But social commentary is the last thing Winchester needs, especially when the movie turns pretty much into a shooting spree towards the end. ",0
51390," It's a startlingly poised, modern-day fairy tale, a strange marriage of Jane Campion and Lars Von Trier that titillates, terrifies and haunts in equal measure.",1
7528," The Good Night has flashes of bookish wit, but never quite recovers from the metronomic monotony of its first half.",0
230484," Composed out of almost nothing but half-measures and recycled ideas, and the result is worse than terrible: it's astoundingly mediocre and plodding.",0

222258," Even if horror or thrillers aren't your genre, it's still a great movie.",1
55513," Provocative, though it never builds to astonishing peaks of illness. Instead, it remains somewhat faithful to the crime, which is just crazy enough to keep the feature intriguing.",1

27589," ""My All American"" scores additional points for its emotional impact.",1
183895, Hoffman the director can't compete with Hoffman the film's star. And he can pretty much just stand in wonder at the layers co-star Amy Ryan brings to the party. The woman is a natural wonder.,1

233600," A calm, visually beautiful fable of peace, love, and understanding in the face of oppression.",1
230811," Along with comedy dismemberings, farcical GBH and the barbecuing of human hands, the movie offers the equally gruesome spectacle of a metaphor being clubbed to death.",0

165965," An Oscar-worthy performance stuck in a mediocre script, basically a great Freddie Mercury impersonator lip-syncing Queen's greatest hits for 2 hours. Entertaining but hollow.",1
196509," Skip, jump, run away, whatever! Do anything you have to do to avoid Hop, which treats its plot like a formality and its young viewers like brainwashed twits.",0
48298, Nice look at the early life of the Beatles.,1
173601," In addition to the great camerawork, I loved the filmmakers' dry, sardonic method of storytelling.",1
228714," Not even Owen Wilson's potent slacker charm can save it from a fatal lack of any sort of momentum, much less energy, leaving it with the sort of stasis that sucks all the fun right out of the proceedings",0
52110," Anthony Burns' directorial debut is all trappings, with very little there there, giving the mind plenty of time to wander through compare-and-contrast games. Skateland is more soundtrack than substance.",0

154833," The two leads contribute fresh, genuine performances, and what might have been a musty academic exercise gains in tension from Cohen's deft juxtaposing of vocal narration, character detail, and majestic artwork.",1
222097," A big, sloppy, loud, grating mess of a movie.",0
202655," Why pay eight bucks to see this horrifying and sad film about the sort of girl you'd pass on the street without giving her a thought? Because, improbably, it says that life is worth living.",1
63188," Her heart is still gold and her sense of humor fully intact, reminding us why we fell in love with her in the first place.",1
51701," A certain polite withholding, even if it masks some firm conviction or desire, seems to be a coin of the realm in Trefeurig, so it may well be apt that Koppel often films in a register very close to this one.",1

101400, Look at it this way; it could be worse. Your kids could be hooked on Barney.,0

142761," Spike Lee's incendiary farce is too uneven to recommend, but its uncanny timing and sense of outrage are worth noting.",0
4316," Saved by its relative complexity and acting talents, Ingrid Goes West works best as a psychological drama, rather than a social critique of technology.",1
181587," Bunuel was at the height of his powers with this satirical farce that explodes the distance between all things personal and political. ""The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie"" is a timeless and enigmatic masterpiece that psychologically alters its audience",1
522," It holds no surprises, little suspense and never delves beyond the superficial. Yet excellent production, a fine cast and Harryhausen's creatures make it an entertaining, if unsubstantial, episode in epic filmmaking.",1

9575," There's undeniable entertainment value in accidental absurdity, but Passion Play strikes a note of delirium that's downright painful to process.",0
207134," There is no romantic tragedy, nor even a visible grit in the oyster: just a dogged, talented, unassuming professional showing us that it's about the perspiration, not just the inspiration.",1
51513, DeNiro is his usual charming best and Hathaway takes what could have been a one-dimensional character and breathes life into her.,1
19505, I didn't enjoy this movie because it made me believe in God. I enjoyed this movie because it made me believe in people.,1
174849," There is spectacular scenery and architecture to admire and footage of some of the world's best restaurants (tip: don't watch this movie hungry), but the main drawcard is as always the celebrity impressions.",1
81334," Cheadle isn't always successful, but his efforts work out more often than not. And I'd rather see an ambitious film occasionally fall short than a by-the-numbers biography, something this movie avoids at all costs.",1
185765," James Caan and Vera Farmiga are great, but they can't overcome a mediocre premise. ",0
120256," It's a proposal about feelings and finds its audience in every person who want to be moved, have a good time, and even reflect a little. [Full Review in Spanish]",1

6049," All spectacle and little substance, a stop-gap title produced perhaps to keep the brand going while the producers search for a way to bring the series forward.",0
237825," It's a good performance from Gyllenhaal, and perhaps it's too good because he overshadows any of the social commentary with one of the year's most uncomfortable characters.",0
175269," Still offers some fun, but it's a touch dated.",0
221664," While Curious George seems innocuous, it's also slow going for adults and some kids (a couple of bored 8-year-olds walked out during a preview screening). ",0
163761, Finding Nemo 3D is a quality post-conversion experience that successfully enhances the 2003 film's original standout visuals.,1
199680," This is mainstream Hollywood filmmaking at its best -- packed with intelligence, humour and pathos.",1
241827," Unfortunately Smith's performance lacks subtlety and depth, while the film starts strongly but then just seems to go on and on and on.",0
140846," As with Palindromes, Life During Wartime revolves around a casting gimmick, with its predecessor's roles now embodied by all new performers. ",0
163012," Much of the film is wonderfully imagined, and there is something utterly winning about this tin can topped with binoculars... It's just a shame that, at the end, it trips itself up with its own SENTIMENTALITE. ",1
166628," Even with Smith acting up a storm, what starts out as a potentially fascinating picture about an apocalyptic plague soon devolves into yet another special-effects laden zombie movie.",0
208909," Director Stanley Tucci had everything he needed to make a compelling film about obsession and the flimsy line that separates artistic genius from madness... Instead, the whole affair is as stale as a week-old baguette. ",0

222494, Rarely has a film looked as jaw-dropping as this while being so poorly served by its screenplay.,0

155474, You have to see this thing.,1
215125," It's like some baseball games, where a few nice hits or a double play have to sustain you through a lot of long, dull, lifeless innings. Steroids, of course, are bad for baseball. But they might have helped bulk up this movie.",0
227078, A visceral fever dream that's both entrancing and horrifying,1
177553," if you loved Shaun and Hot Fuzz, don't hesitate. You need some affection for men who are having problems growing up, perhaps.",1

84543," This film IS [Nahuel Perez Biscayart], a force of nature that seems unstoppable but at the same time shows its vulnerability with each beat. [Full Review in Spanish] ",1

59968," Tom Harper does a truly admirable job of using atmosphere and the movie's creepy setting to give audiences a sense of unease, but moves away from the deadly force we were introduced to in 2012, which feels like a bit of a step backwards.",0

198066, Majestic and manly. ,1
206533," An orgy of macho posturing and cheap film-school tricks masquerading as style, a supposedly comic dance of violence and gore that repulses rather than entertains.",0

93636," The scenes of camaraderie among the soldiers are moving, and despite its weaknesses, there is something in Noel that resonates, given our current political climate.",1
207962, A better-than-average debut by a filmmaker who merits watching. Let's hope that he keeps some of his indie spirit when Hollywood comes calling.,1
22351," Dark Night is fascinated by the phenomena of domestic mass shootings, but it's less an act of investigation than one of imagination.",1
142691, Shanghai Knights is a mess. A few ground rules would have helped immensely.,0
17579," The tagline for the new ""Ghost Rider"" movie promises that ""Hell is about to be unleashed!"" Actually, that might be an understatement. After seeing the movie, some might question whether it was the apocalypse that was unleashed.",0
139636," What do Hartnett and Geckt want with Perlman? Mostly, I think, they're just looking for excuses to get into elaborate kung fu fights.",0

119799, A film that lacks complex human dimension to fill out this likable if promotional tale of good will and achievement. ,0
82500," If it weren't for Binoche's warmth, the film might easily sink beneath the stereotype of French culture as overly talky and sex obsessed.",0
126973," Cargo makes the mistake of benching its menace, banishing the undead to blurred shots on the horizon, while doggedly pursuing its theme.",0

222546, Just reading the cutesy title made me lose the will to live halfway through.,0
98307," The Twilight Saga has finally ended, not with a triumphant roar but with the self-satisfied mumble of an inconsiderate lover rolling over and breaking wind as they fall asleep",0

190582, The film has that one slo-mo trick and milks the cow until there's less beef than a Wendy's Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger. ,0
212630, It's so deadly and unintentionally funny (I hope) that it practically defies description. Mr. Joffé should go back to film school as soon as possible.,0
96140," During the film's final sequence the director explains all while also suggesting that the franchise's nuttiest days are, remarkably, yet to come.",1
114568, This satire settles for simply restating the obvious.,0

170331," It's a testament to French-Canadian director Maxime Giroux's control over his material that, as seemingly random or absurd as the events and imagery in The Great Darkened Days may appear, they all feel ruled by a genuine and moving emotion at their core. ",1
203163," There is value to ""Whose Streets?"" but it suffers from a single minded anger without enough background context.",1
7702, A follow-up that's both funny and filthy.,1
29434," Despite some teasing it's obvious who's who and what's what; but if the story holds next to no surprises, it does unload some brutally ugly shocks.",1
157302," Though The Jungle Book largely was shot in a Los Angeles warehouse, it seriously looks like a beautiful journey through the Indian jungle. Every leaf is too real to be from a computer.",1
197762, An efficient and modernized take on classic literature. [Full review in Spanish],1
170192," The book was explicit in its indictment of Clinton (or his clone or whatever), but the movie, while keeping most of the storyline the same and many of the scenes literally verbatim, still manages to tiptoe around the issue of personal responsibility.",0

150884," In a traditionally excellent, subtle performance, Langella embodies a man recapturing his purpose.",1
77404," For the most part, Baywatch resembles a scarce amount of its origin and relies on a none-too-arch humor that misses more than it hits.",0
77410," A person could be smart and attentive and still be hopelessly lost in this thick labyrinth of espionage. Right? I mean, it's not like I failed to grasp Mr. Popper's Penguins.",0
247042, the subjects are all charismatic and interesting - any of them could have been the focus of their own documentary,1

248674," I went into The World's End hoping for the best, but the best I could summon up after about two hours were some encouraging smiles. ",0
53986, The shame of this mess of a movie is that it could have been quite good.,0
218540," Leaves all those computer-rendered mummies, aliens and tomb raiders in the dust.",1
53488," Its main appeal, however, still rests with the beautiful images and haunting battles; they'll stick with you long after the particulars of the plot have faded.",1
148366," Gone Girl promises to be an unnerving portrait of marriage as ruin, but then it opts for madness and implausibility.",0
233564, Everything about this movie feels forced.,0
155412," (The) franchise takes on an invigorated energy, ending on a series of cliffhanger developments that coalesce with clarity.",1
248960," An enjoyable brain-scrambler of a thriller with strong performances from all three leads, though the emotional impact is ultimately lost amidst all the twists and turns.",1
202658, There's so much plot being thrown at us in Love Actually that there's little room for genuine emotion; the film is as superficial as a Jay Leno monologue.,0
141654, [McQuarrie] spreads a unearned veneer of intelligence over...a plot one character aptly describes as 'grassy-knoll ludicrous.',0

211306, Paul Feig is becoming one of the most interesting comedy directors today.,1
107607," It has some terrific thrills and it's probably worth a video rental, but overall it's yet another case of action over ideas and messages over emotions.",0

57068, It requires more concentration to just figure out what's going on than most summer blockbusters do.,1
121194," It has plentiful whimsy, a big enough heart and Joan Plowright in one fine scene, burbling magnificently. It treats its archetypes with all due seriousness: Good must engage evil in a final stand. And fatherless children must try to save the world.",1

6893," July is a provocative and honorably independent filmmaker, but given the meager rewards of investing our time, ""The Future"" wasn't worth the wait.",0
229254," It is, as it should be, a slight, mischievous, light-footed film, full of imagery.",1
21655," While it may have been directed by a man, albeit one with all the talent of a water bra, it's screenplay is credited to three women who have managed to make Defending the Caveman seem like the height of exposing our Martian tendencies.",0
199373, The Mummy buries the clear moral themes that make superhero movies so popular. Making light of darkness may curse this franchise.,0
137873," When your movie is about a guy who can take out an entire room of thugs without breaking stride, it sure would be nice to actually see it.",0
47882," The movie forces you to work, but any puzzle addict will be exhilarated by the effort.",1
118356, [A] entertaining computer-animated comedy that delivers a feast of family fun for the festive season.,1
57657," The human interaction and tension works, how every single member can be sacrificed for the larger good of the humankind. But the acting is uniformly dull, the cast is deadpan, poker-faced and robotic at best. ",0
193467, A failure on every conceivable level.,0
36114," Right off the bat the viewer is placed in the exact same situation the police and hostages were at the time, setting the precedence for an immersive, if somewhat generic action thriller.",1
182300, As honest a title as one is likely to find gracing a multiplex marquee.,1
207078," As it stands, Battle: Los Angeles is good dumb fun. A little less talking and a little weirder alien and it might have been something more.",1
67149," Puerile beyond belief and a possible hazard to brain cells, the only thing this offensive dross gets right is the title.",0
160611," Besides the specific political and historical elements, the film is a slow, quiet meditation on a very different way of life.",1
171238, [Onata Aprile's] tremendously-believable on-screen spirit reminds us how resilient children can be.,1
98755, A lifeless attempt to fuse a taut crime thriller and a complex psychological drama.,0
155952," Saoirse Ronan brings a preternatural maturity to this starring role, but, most importantly, a sense of urgency, which is largely missing from much of the big-name cast.",0
100337, A blast to watch if for nothing more than the performances.,1
226061, Maybe the laziest and shoddiest family holiday fare on film ever perpetrated. No glowing memories to be found here at all.,0
72064, Meyers makes an admirable argument for the value of seniors in the workplace. If only she hadn't delivered it in a contrived fairy tale.,0
39400," Cuba Gooding Jr. valiantly mugs his way through Snow Dogs, but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy.",0
118619," I'm sure I could find a fault somewhere in this film if I really tried, but it wouldn't be significant enough to matter. The King's Speech is perfect.",1
183613," In spirit a classical European fairy tale, full of wonder and terror … a pinnacle of artistic achievement that, after Bambi, classic Disney would never even try to match again.",1
8005," Director Mira Nair chooses to go flabbily macro with the story's riches-to-radicals themes, as opposed to pointedly micro. ",0
48593," What I love about Casablanca is that it defies categorization into any single genre. It's a war movie, a spy movie and a romantic drama, laced with bracing humor.",1

11194," It's nothing you haven't seen in Behind Enemy Lines, but it does provide Biel one more opportunity to start stripping.",0
60237," [Blu-ray Review] This Blu-ray disc of ""Hammer of the Gods"" looks aesthetically beautiful, brought to life in all its moody, fog-drenched glory. My only wish is that the film itself was better.",0
92589," A beautiful, slow, startling, surprising, and bloody experience all at once.",1
101238," As Vendetta winds up, the movie gets a little lazy, and a little wacky (it shows some of the lack of discipline that troubled the Matrix sequels).",0
9291, I did not feel judged or preached to but merely I had spent 2 hours with some pretty nice people who had a thing or two to teach me.,1
24470," A meandering, underwhelming attempt at a psychological horror story.",0
106193," The more preachy and pious the film becomes, the more muddled and unexciting it starts to feel.",0
47123, The harrowing story of three lesbian couples and their adoption fights in Alabama shows just how far we've come as a country in terms of equal rights and how far we have to go state by state to really get there.,1
10583," A brilliant entertainment, highlighted by Luchini's almost constantly perplexed expression...a subtle tale of personal relationships.",1
240364," It's simply a fun, silly comedy, but then what's wrong with that?",1
197274," Genuinely original: a silly, hilarious and oddly profound adaptation for adult-sized children.",1
164683, An adult drama rich in emotional textures.,1
634," Everybody Loves Somebody doesn't deviate far from the expected rom-com playbook... Nonetheless, the film makes an effective, embraceable statement on realistic expectations of what love can be.",1
200636," I urge all my readers to see the film and judge it for yourselves. It is, at the very least, one of the most thought-provoking releases of the year.",1
103855," Both a commentary on the joys and pains of indie filmmaking, and a sly and deviously funny look at perceived identity via physical appearance, Chained for Life plays a discordant yet strangely sweet song.",1
181943," Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close just doesn't seen to have any point, and is sentimental and banal as well as very, very long.",0
121367," Masterwork of craft, manipulating viewer emotions to elicit unthinking responses and unabashed bloodlust.",0
28403," While watching Werner Herzog's My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done you might be tempted to murmur, ""My Werner, My Werner, What Have Ye Done.""",0
138729," A preposterous ending, saturated in baptismal overtones, is the last straw.",0
221464," Not only is Misery the best adaptation of a Stephen King book ever made, it's the only good one ever made!",1
142044," Young viewers looking for unbridled raunch will be sadly disappointed, and so will other moviegoers expecting more than a few wan chuckles.",0
135414," A distinctive vision, but a familiar story.",0
153073, Everything's so crammed and asphyxiating you can't help leave wondering if the filmmakers wanted you to think this was meant to launch a franchise or what in the hell.,0
251840," Director Joshua Oppenheimer shines a light on one of the 20th century's most under-reported atrocities, but his film, years in the making, is so much more than a straightforward history lesson.",1
158408," The movie is a good cautionary example of what happens when its maker is too close to the material, who can't see the forest for the trees, the story for the ape.",0
235660," Beautifully written and directed, this fact-based drama is an odd mixture of excellent acting and not-quite-right casting.",1
146168, An overly manufactured would-be tearjerking package that will surely give less savvy moviegoers the illusion that they've watched an Important and Meaningful Film.,0
244957," We've grown so used to lowest-common-denominator blockbuster cinema that it's almost shocking to watch a big science fiction movie, featuring these kinds of stars, swinging for the fences in this way.",1
125579, At no point do any of the characters ever behave like human beings and this is because they aren't-they are merely ciphers who do stupid things because it is the only way that screenwriter Dave Collard could move his absurd tale along from point A to poin,0
76402," There's a lot of the unspoken in Call Me by Your Name, a perceptive film about lust, jealousy, uncertainty, repression, and, maybe, love.",1
118588," Central Intelligence won't blow you out of the theater, but you might be surprised at how well it works - how genuinely funny it is - given the familiarity of this concept.",1
199846," Concept aside, it's Mark Digby's production design and Rob Hardy's cinematography that really make the film, along with an atmospheric score...",1
151506," Gorgeously photographed, and as loosey-goosey as its hero, ""Captain Fantastic"" takes some unexpected turns.",1
118719," In a time of cynicism and divisiveness, I found Restoring Tomorrow to be genuinely inspiring. ",1
85434," A finely drawn human drama, it just fails to go far enough with the supernatural elements.",1
215597," It's a fascinating Benjamin Button-like premise and Lively shines in the lead, capturing the wisdom and weariness of someone over a century old. But it fails to explore what Adaline has done with her immortal life or the events of the 20th century.",1
12," Gets off to such an incoherent start that it takes almost the entire, interminable two-hour-plus running time to catch up.",0
130231, [A] gently humourous doc.,1
28628," As alien invasions go, this ranks as one of the most inept in movie history.",0
89605, No creative inspiration gets in the way of the beautiful people running and jumping and kissing while things go boom in the forgettable teen sci-fi actioner I Am Number Four. [Blu-ray],0
186859," Almost too self-consciously beautiful, The Guardians creates a picturesque trope of rural France during World War I.",1
34426, Sometimes as compelling as it is unoriginal. ,0
82610," It makes for a lively, entertaining guide to the LA music scene in the 70s and 80s and the film business - Gordon dabbled in movie production.",1
30009, Keeps you involved and in suspense until the last moment.,1
113511," Like a bad mixtape created by the abominable Ark Music Factory, Rock of Ages is all flash and very, VERY little substance. ",0
201595," tends to stay with you... for days, weeks even",1
237793," Appropriately titled, You Again won't win any prizes for originality but it does deliver just enough girly fun.",1
170599," Schwimmer just doesn't have the directorial wit to elevate the intermittently amusing script, and none of the cast seems dedicated enough to raise the bar either.",0
214019," When it comes right down to it, The Best Man isn't exciting, it isn't poignant, and the lessons learned in the end aren't particularly worth learning.",0
179619," The cast of unknown actors, many from the real ghetto, provides the movie with unexpected heart and humor.",1
228060," Anderson's seventh feature film is a groovy, richly funny stoner romp.",1
70830, Probably Norman Jewison's best picture.,1
49197, At once divinely inspired and gut-wrenchingly horrible.,0
165515, The auto carnage lacks flair or creativity.,0
219126, Underscores how feelings of self-worth make all the difference in the lives of adolescents.,1
67864, My only significant gripe against the movie is that it's not a sequel to Iron Giant.,1
53058," ""Infinitely Polar Bear"" is a small, insightful look into the perils of bad mental health. It doesn't solve any issues, nor does it claim to. It's a lovely tribute to Maya Forbes' own difficult childhood.",1
143105," The director has attempted to construct quite a complex little film here, but only parts of this delicate concoction work effectively. The movie feels like a strange, lightweight piece of ephemeral fluff.",0
132348," While the plot is overtly absurd (nearly every scene leads to a shoot-out, beating, or car chase), the film never lets up on those ""Save Our Streets"" demonstrations.",1
164666, Any sympathy developed for the characters quickly erodes as they continue to not only engage in self-destructive behavior but expose children to it.,0
8387," ...what we mostly get here, unfortunately, is...akin to an Asian minstrel show.",0
99863," Before The Devil Knows You're Dead plays around a bit with time and perception, and the story unfolds at a tremendous clip. The movie is not without its share of black humour, but it's an exercise in violence and adrenalin. And tragedy.",1
222967," At times, the prolonged bickering can wear a bit thin, but strong, ebullient performances mean The Journey is definitely worth taking.",1
240989," Somewhat intellectually mushy and sentimental, though never less than visually impressive.",1
40427," For half an hour, with brutish hunks abusing teens in torn clothes, we think: ""Sexploitation!"" Then stately, plump Beau Bridges appears, a corrupt federal marshal resembling a gone-to-girth Timothy Spall, and the story starts.",1
164656, Peele has created another marvelous new American horror story.,1
190746," Robert Pattinson has to do an awful lot of hollow-eyed smouldering in this hammily enunciated French period drama, taken from the 1885 novel by Guy de Maupassant.",0
128693," Because there's no mystery, no chemistry and paper-thin characters, the movie coasts by on the charms of its two stars. And while Eckhart and Aniston are mighty appealing, they need to be given something more with which to work.",0
225909, Sudeikis has perhaps the most challenging role. He struggles to find the right pitch.,0
701, Miss Stevens is an infinitely charming movie with an emotionally honest core.,1
67274," ""Song of the Sea"" is the best feature-length animated film of 2014. ",1
197496," Paul Verhoeven' Black Book encompasses the best and very worst of its director's signature pulp brutalism, which means it's pretty much a hoot.",1
125445," Like A History of Violence, David Cronenberg's brilliant new film goes far beyond its thriller genre.",1
69888, The warmth and heart are back full force in this third-times-the-charm edition of Disney/Pixar's charmer of an animated franchise.,1
48890," The time that monopolizes food and earthly pleasures resents the characters and narrative arc of the film, which never manages to offer us a solid story and a conclusive ending. [Full review in Spanish]",0
19102," Even when tragedy strikes early on, the revelation is just another ""growing up is hard"" dot on the grid.",0
154231," Blimey, this is miserable.",0
154034, This hairball on the soiled rug of the summer blockbuster schedule is gruesome enough to have been ejected from the esophagus of Bill the Cat...,0
152237," Reading about the South African leader will provide deeper understanding; to do audio/video dramatic justice to Mandela and his story, a miniseries is probably in order.",0
31889," ...about the surface of faces, the magic of motion, the qualities of light, and the possibilities of color. A film should always strive to be as wonderful as Breathe.",1
118717," As depressing as the first two-thirds of the film is, the last third is surprisingly empowering and hopeful.",1
125574," Mei, a teenage girl, retreats to a fantasy world when her parents announce they are divorcing in a drama with touches of magical realism.",0
131719, ...it's the film's fearless go-for broke style which makes I Love You Phillip Morris such a success.,1
494, Director and co-writer Philippe Le Guay deploys a gift for wry observation with a deftly understated approach that defuses the danger of triteness and makes the film a satisfying experience.,1
159810, Largely keeps John McClane off American soil and removes the crucial homeland insecurity that drove the franchise from day one.,0
46572, Vitkova wrangles this grandiose story of political upheaval into a vibrant piece of filmmaking that feels singular and overwhelming.,1
82993," Itâ(TM)s hard to be wowed by films of this stature, especially when there are clichÃ (C)s at every turn and inconsequential characters crop up so opportunely, but go with it; at very worst itâ(TM)s still fun for the ride.",1
68048," Vaughn's spin on American iconography lacks the verve of his homeland take, with the Statesman resembling beefy models from a 1965 Esquire photo shoot about the new cowboy cool (that is, they are not cool).",0
13592," The result is as offbeat as any of Anderson's films, but more heartfelt than most.",1
168558," Like a souped-up show car, Fast & Furious is all gleaming surfaces and muscular detailing, but there's absolutely nothing going on under the hood.",0
107807," The first Twilight film that works at all on its own, giving us better characters, tense action sequences, and a wry acknowledgement that, yes, this is maybe all a little bit silly.",1
216740, A tremendously entertaining film that consistently pushes the limits of 3D creativity in a way to seem like the images are leaping straight from the comic book panels.,1
224176," Atomic Blonde may be confusing, empty and disappointing, but when sleek and sinewy British MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton goes DEFCON-1 on the bad guys, boredom dies first.",0
215627, Rahim more than rises to the challenge of making Malik utterly compelling throughout his journey. Mr. Arestrup manages to use his physical frailty to convey enormous threat in a way no English-speaking star of that generation would be willing to match.,1
219990," Jack Black's crude, unsophisticated comedy has never much appealed to this reviewer - a scene in which the giant urinates all over comedic great Billy Connolly says it all.",0
184359," For a guerrilla-style, no-budget Yank indie to even tackle issues of jihad terror and naive Western thinking is noteworthy in itself, but Gamazon and Dela Llana inflame the issues with a gutsy, athletic filmmaking package.",1
89323," Though not a great horror film by any means, Final Destination 5 succeeds as a comedic splatter fest solely by sticking to Stephen King's old motto: 'If in doubt, gross 'em out.'",1
131716, The schlock-horror signal in which they've been bathed makes them believe that their grindhouse misogyny is the human condition.,0
209511, Maybe the screenwriters were chemically altered when they decided that this stoner comedy was funny.,0
211943," Where other documentaries about murder might forensically reconstruct the crime or the prosecution, or ask hand-wringing questions about public policy, this deeply empathetic film derived its power from a less inquisitive approach. ",1
98708," [Gareth Edwards'] technical vision shines through in the battle scenes, but his work with actors leaves something to be desired",1
153818," It's a succession of soulless scenes, generally dialogues in interiors where the characters explain their past, their present circumstances and their future plans, but never transmit emotions. [Full review in Spanish]",0
34427, It's amazing how little Stay Alive actually knows about the videogame culture in which its terror-lite tale is set.,0
35393," If Entourage has any message about the superficiality of the movie industry, it would be, ""Hell yeah, we're all for it.""",0
67161," Animated or not, this is the best Batman movie.",1
160488," Some solid special effects (they got Godzilla right), lots of stuff blowing up and plenty of cool creatures that make this a classic monster movie, but it needs more Bryan Cranston and more humanity. ",0
90734," A repellant, mostly unfunny, distasteful-and-not-in-a-good-way mess of mixed messages and tonal confusion.",0
57908," [Langella's] finely shaded performance is the main reason to check out [this] gently affecting film that portrays the fragility of life, love and art with sympathy and taste.",1
214974, the Big Bad Wolf in this fairytale is Naomi Wolf.,0
195277, Oliver Blackburn's British thriller Donkey Punch offers such a unique thrill: It indulges in juvenile scares by placing them in a larger canvas of sophisticated moods.,1
44881," Chris Rock returns to us with things to say and share, with humor that serves as a nice respite as we ourselves march on and endure.",1
205410, Rarely has one absorbing premise unraveled so quickly under the weight of the ludicrous twist.,0
99210," A smarter script might've allowed these missteps to be baked into the film's appeal; instead, the film serves as a welcome reminder that action-comedy is rarely as easy as the best make it look.",0
150074," It ends up a one-joke picture, with feeble variations.",0
152814," Private Life tackles worthy feminist issues about raising a family and sacrificing your career, but it is also too overlong and meandering to have any true resonance.",0
161107," Like a commander-in-chief who's too good-naturedly dumb to be dangerous, the writer-director is ultimately too forgiving to do much bruising. (Or maybe too calculating, which kind of blurs into the same thing.)",0
199502," The Rajini-Ranjith combo takes this risk and passes the test by a considerable margin. However, not with flying colours.",0
149246," A word about the film's epic length. Boyhood is 166 minutes long. Yet it is so affecting, so much a thing of wonder, that it could run forever and I would still keep watching.",1
142936," ...has a wacky side, but the wackiness does not tread outside the boundaries of the story.",0
150597," The film's big problem is only too familiar. The victims are so cliched that we never care about them, still less identify with them.",0
104450," A flat, unappealing potion!",0
229606, There are aspects of this approach that are refreshing. Noxon clearly knows the territory. But the end result is confusing and unfocused.,0

7687, Intent to Destroy may not inspire many people to watch The Promise - which is currently streamable on Amazon - but at least The Promise allowed Intent to Destroy to be made.,1
211581," A peculiar slice of 19th-century cultural life is mined to minimal effect in Effie Gray, a stillborn labour of love that doesn't justify the long slog from screenwriter and supporting player Emma Thompson required to bring this tale to the screen.",0
225802, one of those rare films that runs on all cylinders,1
187549," A vehicle for wall-to-wall action, and an unambiguously fond farewell to the Obama years.",1
21914, Despite Linklater's best efforts the movie goes nowhere because the narrative is pretty much non-existent.,0
90785," ""The Five-Year Engagement"" dutifully hits the marks of its genre, but it is also about the unpredictability of life and the everyday challenges of love. The sensitivity and honesty with which it addresses those matters is a pleasant surprise.",1
41087," Apart from [two action] scenes and the initial setup, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter becomes repetitive.",0
219650," A must-watch work of cine-activism, one that should be seen by anyone headed to college and by those already on campus.",1
168985," [Maria] Mozhdah empathetically charts Nisha's despairing acquiescence and fitful rebellions, but it's Adil Hussain's work making her father not entirely unsympathetic that really stands out.",1
55716," Reynolds does a tremendous job of presenting a hardened, cocky L.A. demeanor and allowing cracks of old despair and self-doubt to chip cracks in the façade.",1
251618, It's a complete fraud that never feels the least bit authentic in its efforts to titillate and shock.,0

124995," Unfiltered depiction of Marines, as they really are, in a combat zone. ",1
174778, Some of it is lame - would you really leave your webcam on during such a crisis? - but it keeps you guessing as it serves up a very current and sobering parental nightmare.,1
113354," Constructed as a comical lesson kit on winning and losing, Little Miss Sunshine perks into considerable life through its quality cast.",1
171761," Perhaps the asynchronous editing will take a moment to key into for the modern viewer. But go with Welles, and you will see wonders.",1
75509, An agonizingly well-crafted slog through a series of shocking emotional extremes.,1
239392," The film revels in its violence, merrily mowing down people so as to capture the coolest car chase possible. ",0
148444," Furthermore, the film lazily utilises a fake documentary format that only seeks to highlight how much better the story was told in The Price of Gold. ",0
88649, A very good performance in a somewhat incomplete and less than wholly satisfying historical expose ,1
110126, A good-for-you movie that's going through the motions.,0
55340," All the darkness comes laced with humour. Raghavan takes you to the edge of the seat with the pulse racing, makes you keep guessing even as you are chuckling.",1
93689," Hanks is compelling...and a new star is born in stand-up comic Alexander Black... But the adaptation is problematic, Tykwer incorporating his own research experiences in bits that go nowhere, the romance a seemingly one-sided male fantasy.",0
39736," The film is tough-minded, often grim and intense, its lessons about death and grief hard in ways you aren't conditioned to expect from pricey CGI entertainments.",1
80772," It's the most infuriating kind of comedy, one that keeps flirting with sharp ideas, only to retreat into barn-door-broad buffoonery.",0
51250, Sets a new record for gross stupidity.,0
74537," We're not swept away by it, but caught up almost on a cerebral level, which was, I'm sure, Borleteau's intention: in that she challenges as much as her lead character.",1
193423," Remarkably, Maine never feels like some kind of pointed rejoinder to the wilderness self-discovery narrative that serves as a popular fantasy.",1
174579," Game, set, match, even if the win's a tad exhausting.",1
104231," A mediocre, poorly paced thriller ...",0
195828," The film is entertaining, surprising and Gleeson is once again on top of his game. If only director McDonagh had made some room for Cheadle and Mark Strong to shine as well.",1
128844," Compared with most big-studio releases this summer, Perdition is quality cinema. Trouble is, it should've been one of the great gangster movies.",1
148898, It's not inaccurate to say that The 15:17 to Paris succeeds better as a European touristic attraction rather than a look at average-Joe bravery,0
240142, Time was clearly taken here to do better than fine with material that had a sizeable no-brainer audience built right into the title.,1
83575," That fart sound, ladies and gentleman, is that of Kattan's movie career smashing into a brick wall.",0

191831," As comical and critical as it is decadent, Emmanuel Mouret's film eventually hits a sour note that's unfortunately too predictable for a work made by a man.",1
132370," As a filmmaker, [Jeunet's] prime virtues have to do with textural details, discursive forays into character, little grace notes that accrete into rueful human - and humane - comedy.",1
62935," Whether experiencing the exuberance of the dance sequence, however mesmerizing it might be, is worth suffering through the sludge of the post-rehearsal meltdown is doubtful.",0
149238," Neeson's charisma, Whitaker's gravitas, and a few smart action choices supplying action junkies with enough vitamins to live another day.",1
52438," Gored is interesting, but it stays there, it feels like the focus of the film was too specific, with a topic that's pretty broad with multiple variables that merit exploration. ",0
169782," Such a brain dead, jukebox of a movie, it should've been called Tron for Dummies.",0
193687," Black seems to be aiming for some sort of loopy fantasia, a tragic fable about struggling with difference in the small-town South, but he's got more half-finished ideas than he can handle.",0
165121," What I miss most of all is the absence of the late, great Mel Blanc.",0
13542," Its images are most obviously big in size, more importantly fluid in movement in a way not equaled (let alone attempted) by just about anything you might find anywhere.",1
145371," If you're not bored of Marvel by now, this will probably be one of your favourite films of 2014. If you are bored of Marvel by now, then rest assured that this is probably the strongest of their phase two movies so far. ",1
165592," It's a stunning film, no question, with sexuality that is quite frank for its day, effective atmosphere and, of course, Brooks' stunning performance.",1
152032," At its core, Mountain is nature porn at its finest; between the lines, it becomes a beautiful extrapolation on the incessant drive for man to conquer nature.",1
212982," Using every modern tool at its disposal, First Man has again presented just how harrowing that frontier was at the time, in the process planting its flag among the year's best movies.",1
67158," I don't know guys, at the end of the day it's aliens and hard for me to take this seriously.",1
22645, Of all of the Marvel franchises Thor always felt the most difficult to pull off (he is a virtually indestructible God after all) but here it all ties together rather well.,1
75564," The film will do very little to win over non-fans of low-budget horror filmmaking, but Never Open the Door is undeniably ambitious, and a charming throwback to a less represented era in the genre.",1

250420," In Marc Foster's cure-the-hate melodrama, chocolate love goes a long way in soothing frayed white-black relations.",0
154869," Good science fiction awakens a sense of awe, and even mediocre sci-fi sometimes manages wonder. But The Core does neither.",0
196620," Dull jokes, a bloated running time and a lack of proper pacing is somewhat remedied by a charmingly honest representation of a dysfunctional family.",1
187034, Body of Lies is certainly one of most well-crafted and intellectually engaging political thrillers to come along this year.,1
64353," The film looks great with great scenery, costumes, special effects and action scenes. Except for Kristen Stewart, who is somewhat miscast here, the acting is solid by the rest of the cast.",1

184899, A delicious romantic-comedy.,1
76046," Although it goes on one stilled heartbeat too long, Anthony Minghella's masterpiece, an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's creepy favorite The Talented Mr. Ripley, is indeed fashioned the old, classical way.",1
189505," It's a hopeless task to point out incessant clichés, formulaic story structure and sappy nonsense that cheerfully take up residence in the Garry Marshall Experience",0
87177, Curious George is a sweet and gentle film that views the world as a wonderful place to be explored.,1
117227," While Guess Who gets some mileage out of its black and white issues, it's more focused on being the interracial romantic comedy answer to Meet the Parents.",0

114006," While Spider-Verse is colorful, whip-fast and full of visual references to the four-color printing process and comic book sound effects, it never overwhelms.",1
26168," In a misconceived dallying with culture clash, Julie Delpy's exploration in this disappointing follow up to 2 Days in Paris never even gets close to taking off",0
43940," It is light, rather than heavy metal, marked by invigorating war-machine FX and a smart and subtle acting performance, at least by the standards of this genre.",1
198748, Hollywood has found it tricky translating the whimsical magic of Dr Seuss' tales from page to screen and the makers of The Lorax don't fully pull off the feat here.,0
223124," Calling this (lackluster) movie 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' is misleading. Naming it 'The Future Men from U.N.C.L.E.' is probably too cumbersome, but truthful.",0
215441," if you love Lennon's music and if you'd like to be transported back to that tumultuous era, the film does this all quite well.",1
112052," Those who came of age during Knievel's rise, rise and fall will enjoy the fun moments. But this family-sanctioned film comes up short in terms of objectivity.",1

123868," The swaggering humour that made Diesel a star in Pitch Black, The Fast and the Furious and XXX is barely evident here.",0
32748," With its harrowing peekaboo mayhem-Johnson turns the Whites' house into a cunningly compartmentalized stage set-and its ruthless psychological manipulation, Hounds of Love is a relentless exercise in terror. ",1
232123, The Paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final (restored) third...emotionally belittle a cinema classic. Sometimes shorter is better.,1
114713, Hallström is an old pro at navigating this kind of undemandingly dramatic yarn and does a pretty fine job with Sparks' story.,1
224563," Cringe-inducing comedy by New Zealander Taika Waititi more or less exemplifies the divide currently dictating taste in movie comedy, a schism reducible to a single question: Do you want to laugh with people, or at them?",0
144624," It's fun, but not fantastic.",1
18697," [Lewis] and a rambunctious Skarsgård goose up the movie. Without them, it sags.",1

29127," It warmly records humour, eccentricity, love and bereavement -- and conflict, too.",1
45491," Winn-Dixie has everything but the drama, and while that doesn't make it a dog, it never raises it above the status of stuffed toy.",0
66506," Fury's violent decapitations and exploding torsos feel exploitative or, worse, uninteresting, because the film never quite earns the dramatic stakes it strives for.",0
70515," Quiet but pungent and featuring vibrant performances, it offers further evidence that the rebirth of Tunisian cinema is underway, and after its bow in Berlin competition it should find welcoming art film slots.",1
248442," The cutesy ending suggests that the film's heart is at least in the right place, but the tiresome histrionics and uniformly overwrought performances end up doing nothing but taking a wrecking ball to the considerable reputations of all concerned.",0

221506," We spend more time with Saroo looking at maps, looking at Google Earth, and pushing people away than we do with him considering the fact that he's never really assimilated into Australian culture.",0
222836," Admittedly, it's also a touch flavour-free, but it applies itself to telling its story single-mindedly, with a minimum of digression and frills.",1
36658," Somehow manages to be sweet and progressive, as well as a timely release in the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp.",1
154430," It's not The Incredibles, or one of those animated features that spent zillions on character design, pedigree and verisimilitude. But SpongeBob is a sweet, silly thing with a child-friendly esthetic all its own.",1

59524," I have seen Charlie Kaufman's stop-motion, animated drama ""Anomalisa"" twice, and both times the sheer technical skill of this motion picture burst my eyeballs.",1
233577," A bruised and beautifully layered piece of storytelling, which zeroes in on our desire for connection.",1

207719, Walker creates indelible documentary portraits of six workers that round out Muniz's very unusual physical portraits. [Not] the usual saccharine shock at poverty.,1

226272," Once upon a time, great movies about American political conspiracies were the domain of Oliver Stone. Now, that cinematic realm clearly belongs to Michael Moore.",1
154035," ""Vox Lux""... never does anything with its most intriguing themes: the commodification of tragedy and the hollowness of fame.",0
215085," Daredevil, as brought to the screen by writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, brings real violence and death into the comic book mix, and the result is a fascinating blend of the fantastic and the tragic.",1
200255, Legendary hipster filmmaker Jim Jarmusch's wryly funny exercise in genre bending hits so many grace notes it ends up being his most satisfying film in years.,1
28447, John Cusack is very much miscast here. He was about as believable as Matthew Broderick would be as Abraham Lincoln.,0
193867," A very humane drama with comic elements, excellent performances and an unique premise. [Full review in Spanish]",1
37983," At 121 minutes, Battle of the Sexes occasionally drags, but it's the Hairy Legged Feminist-Male Chauvinist Pig showdown that we needed right now.",1
214224, George sustains this lightweight soap opera with the predictable pap of a Lifetime channel movie...this particular Road is certainly under construction.,0
114197," This is the kind of filmmaking that gets touted as ""workmanlike"" when it's really straight-laced to the point of tepidness.",0
80644," This lighthearted meditation on life, death, love and timing contains some genuinely lovely scenes, but they're buried in a shapeless jumble of cutesy-pie vignettes.",0
3504, The whole film deserves close attention and repeat viewings.,1
106910, Someone somewhere will probably try to foist The Last House on the Left remake off as some sort of social commentary. Don't be fooled. It's not.,0
124695," Refusing to hit us on the head with its message, 1945 instead subtly reveals the complicity of ""good"" people are capable of when outside forces target their neighbors.",1
133786," It's a treat to feast on these iconic images and here the stories behind them, although Rock is so laconic and hippy-dippy about his craftsmanship it ends up doing something of a disservice to his artistry ...",1
85963," Jumper is a movie with no special powers. Despite its slick and sleek approach to extraordinary events, it remains quite ordinary and remarkably nondescript.",0
208558," Is it an Amy Schumer movie directed by Judd Apatow, or a Judd Apatow movie that stars Amy Schumer? It's hard to tell...",1
56032, Girl-powered sports film is predictable but sweet.,1
225072," Humans and parched vampires engage in endless skirmishes of hide and seek, while corporate meanies go about concocting efficient farming and drainage systems of homo sapiens in profiteering captivity.",0
69261," Funny -- it turns out that when the zombie apocalypse is upon us, Escalades and Hummers will actually have a practical use.",1
69704, Demon House is patent balderdash; it's paranormal snake-oil salesmanship that degrades the real life unfortunates involved in the case.,0

46789, ...ultimately comes off as one of the most ineffective and flat-out dull entries within the ongoing series.,0
143725," The film's three leads deliver competent yet thoroughly uninspired performances, with Wilson offering up the latest variation on his laid-back, cool-guy persona...",0
201807," This film needed blood, needed the horror, needed the morbid inventiveness a higher age rating would allow.",0

5402, There are so many characters the film can't keep track of them and none of these supposedly interconnecting stories gel.,0
124030," Someone maybe should've told this guy if you want to rekindle a romance with a woman, you probably shouldn't start by sleeping with all her friends.",0
220705, Let me tell you: Having my feet scraped with a scapel and rubbed down with acid by my podiatrist was more enjoyable than sitting through this miserable film.,0
11873," Vile, hateful and undeniably funny.",1
251272," As a peace-loving liberal, cross-examining Morgen's rousing, worthy, but slanted film is as fun as kicking yourself in the shins (or watching Clinton tear into Obama)",1
226712," Insightful, timely, provocative and enraging, but a bit dry rather than cinematic at times.",1
201592," Because [The End of the Tour] is a film about language and about two men in dialogue, it's greatness could not have been achieved without the performances.",1
92987," The danger never reaches the level of chaos, but the subtext and metaphor in the slow-moving humanistic commentary on the motivations and byproducts of capitalism make for an intriguing film.",1
157836, Blair Witch's comparatively maximalist approach shows too much and scares too little.,0
15687," Goofy enough that it slightly delivers a degree or two of guilty pleasure entertainment value when not otherwise making you wonder why and how it derailed. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)",0
78562, It is a stunning and joyful experience that I highly recommend for families to watch together.,1
61835," A beautiful piece of work: heart-wrending, atmospheric and truly poignant. Recommended.",1
9976, An explosively rich evocation of a twisted (or at least unhealthy) relationship. Capote would have probably called it suffering for his art.,1
10542," Throughout Seven Pounds, Smith looks tired and drawn but not half as weary as audiences who subject themselves to this, the year's least-enjoyable movie concept.",0
96928," ""Battleship"" is a loud and booming-blow-'em-up movie made for a 12-year-old target audience. Adults should sit this one out - that is, if you don't want to be exposed to a two-hour long headache. ",0
20766," ""American Honey"" tries to approach its American subculture...with a naïveté flush with a sensual, free-flowing and empathetic appreciation of American vivacity.",0
210892, Keen to follow the Judd Apatow formula -- crude gags plus big-hearted sentiment -- Dirty Grandpa winds up losing the courage of its gross-out convictions. Offensive in all the wrong ways.,0
215611, What could have been endearingly daft remains merely forgettable.,0

53567," Portman continues to show strong chops for a young actress, navigating a similarly complicated path between devotion to her mother and intense resentment.",0
227315," What's delightful about ""I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore"" ... is how consistently the film challenges our worst assumptions about humanity even as it confirms them.",1
77048," It would be easy to categorize the Lebanese women's picture Caramel as a Levantine combination of Sex in the City and Beauty Shop, but it's actually a lot smarter, sharper and deeper than that.",1
57842, ... it is still Stone and her depiction of King that is the film's undeniably flawless element.,1
77951," The direction is decent, and the film is handsome. But it's finally frustrating, enigmatic in a way that suggests emptiness more than mystery.",0
127204," The sentiment gets a little sticky towards the end, but many will consider this the perfect antidote to traditional Christmas fare -- especially those with a fondness for Ferrell's comedy.",1
214549," Stripped of pretentions, Last Dance offers up a wholly human, tantalizingly imperfect struggle to create beauty and resonance.",1

242413," Kevin Smith, of ""Clerks,"" delivers a weird in-joke inspired by one of his podcasts. You probably had to be there.",0
86876, Quite a smart little film with a surprising satirical edge.,1
138883," Addiction dramas are as common as reality shows and often just as rank. Smashed joins the ranks of the winners, mostly because of an unmissable and unforgettable performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. ",1
119030," The Island, which belabors itself for about 45 minutes before you have any idea what's afoot, is a clone itself - of Coma, a '70s medical thriller that once seemed so far-fetched it had to be sci-fi.",0
79657," The nonlinear narrative, with its infinite digressions and asides, is designed less to tell a story than to present a world-a world dense in physical detail and fraught with moral challenges.",1
16726," If our On the Road is a barely coherent tightrope act - a fizzy word drunk stand-up speed-rapped by an aspiring poet posing as a dumb saint prole - then it's tough to take this pretty version, populated by Gap models in retro Americana fashions.",0

128984, Corpse Bride turns out to be a ponderous mixture of puppetry and animation that is far too technologically complex and laborious for this hopelessly Luddite reviewer.,0
132934," At the end of 'Bad Santa,' redemption comes for its foul-mouthed main character -- but not for the movie itself.",0
84746," If Apatow had any deeper message, it ends up getting drowned in this mess, but that's bound to happen when you try to take a premise that might barely support 80 minutes and stretch it well past its breaking point. ",0
59670, Quiet moments after big decisions are where the power lies in this absorbing French drama.,1
200843," Magical lands and sorcery add to the movie's mythic structure. While Mika is suitably simpering, the witch is delightfully evil and is a pleasure to watch. As for Reeves, his lines are minimal, but his swordplay does all the talking.",1

213029, A shallow script that never gets at the heart or conflict behind the swagger.,0
195593," Working from a script co-written by James, the film feels like a Die Hard parody that's at least a decade too late. It's sophomoric and rudimentary, the whole thing offering so few laughs I almost fell asleep in the theater while watching it.",0

177151," Soderbergh uses the mechanics of the grimy doll factory ... as metaphor, carefully tracking the shiny distractions we hide behind, revealing the awful little facts about their glued-on eyelashes and the identically blank faces they all start out with.",1
67761," An affecting portrait of a decent man who risks his life to uphold a bond of trust with his students. Though squarely in the tradition of Dead Poets Society and The Bad News Bears, the film offers higher stakes and, consequently, a bigger payoff. ",1
80403, Gripping and fascinating work by first-time filmmaker Jeffrey Blitz. Bravo!,1
121815," As music star movie debuts go, 8 Mile is hardly A Hard Days Night, but it's not Crossroads, either.",0

35437," A tiresome fireworks display starring a cast of cardboard cutouts, quick to make a visceral fuss but frustratingly negligent when it comes to providing a reason to care. ",0
206321, Not genuinely funny enough to be anything more than a silly slapstick comedy without much stick to slap. ,0
1487," Despite its many strengths, Thank You for Smoking hovers around mediocrity, and its lasting impression is like a puff of smoke that is dissipated by a strong gust of wind.",0
77403," A provocative, probing - and yes, often funny - look at the role humor plays in coming to terms with the darkest, most troubling events mankind faces.",1
174567," It's hard to believe that Melville's 1969 masterpiece--one of the most accurate chronicles of the French Resistance--never got released in the US until 2006; Splendidly acted, this film draws on the helmer's own experience.",1
23612," I can imagine that seeing PSYCHOTIC! at a festival as a midnight screening could be fun, but without that cinematic atmosphere the film falls flat. ",0

183816, The magic still sparkles in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.,1
101017," An affectionate, sophisticated parody of Technicolor melodramas and musicals of the 1950s -- with a some mock-Agatha Christie thrown in for fun.",1
126791, One of the most astonishingly idiotic pieces of entertainment I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through.,0
231170, What makes True Stories so wildly different from the dream-visions of all the quirky and hip directors who followed its example is its vehement refusal to condescend to or mock the people on screen.,1
133123, The film would put a smile on the face of Scrooge himself.,1
36611, Directors Stéphane Aubier and Vincent Patar (who also provide voices) display a pleasantly warped sensibility without going for adult humor.,1

194127," Even though there's an enormous amount to look at and digest, little of this film is truly memorable or thought-provoking.",0
15395, The exceptional performances by all concerned ... give heft and dimension to the movie's ambiguities and blank spaces.,1
164748," The nasty, charmless, fatally misjudged Strangeways Here We Come turns out to be one of the worst films of the year rather than the taboo-trampling comic caper it must have once hoped to be.",0

156220, The film is one of the few capable of allowing its watchers to shed a tear and laugh within more or less the same sequence.,1
104093," A star-filled, if heavy-handed, labor of love that certainly has its heart in the right place, and scores dramatically often enough to recommend it.",1
185870, It's disappointing--if not exactly surprising--when at the halfway point the film turns into THE LINDA BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.,0
21708, The film remains a rousing and convincing depiction of the kinds of sacrifices made to enact social change.,1
226093," A challenging and rewarding film experience. A three-hour film in German with English subtitles, is no easy watch, but it moves along at a pace, and the sheer artistry of the cinematography is every bit as important as the dialogue. ",1

224304, The film is a compelling detective story covering the fields of World War II history and film preservation... [and] it's important in shining a light on unsung women in the history of American film.,1
152922, Director D.J. Caruso relies entirely too much on clichéd shock cuts and keeps pulling back every time the flick seems to be settling into anything close to a creepy mood.,0
107, Memories aren't made of this.,0

199734," Girl likes boy who likes boy (or maybe he doesn't) sounds like that recent reality-TV scenario, but there's very little reality at play in this hollowed-out, tricked-up Montreal-based drama.",0

183902," Consistent with the latest generation of these Boulle-based films that started in 2011, it examines the question of who is bestial. Man or ape? It answers the question with an intelligence not often found in Hollywood blockbusters.",1
100383," A film so phony that its makers needed to coin a nonsense word to give it an appropriate title, the irksome Insyriated is the sort of feeble attempt at profundity that crops up in the face of every armed conflict.",0
53516," A bona fide landmark in American film, Bonnie and Clyde stands the test of time the same way its protagonists did: by breaking all the rules. [Blu-Ray]",1
190726, [W]hat might have been a tantalizing whodunit about the less-than-gleaming gears of justice ... is instead a curiously uninvolving exercise in procedure.,0
128437," For any adult, to watch Marmaduke is to stare into the gaping, digitally-enhanced maw of fluffy mediocrity for a ninety-minute stretch of valuable lifetime.",0
102009, An interesting story in search of a take on the material. It's a collection of compelling scenes that don't really add up to a cohesive whole. ,1

24195," The film is directed by Viollet's daughter Rachel, which makes it very much a family affair.",1
242019," There is a narrative arc to Coriolanus, but it moves along at a snail's pace and the main theme of the film (the pride of Gaius vs. the people he's sworn to protect) isn't a grabber.",0

140902, [Maktub] boasts an array of vivid performances that fuse sentiment and buddy film humor with some incredible dark elements relative to Israel's politics and mob business.,1
92427," A rousing opening sequence, plus the stirring William Tell Overture at the end of ""The Lone Ranger"", are not enough to compensate for the disappointing middle of the film. ",0
116129, Its writer/star has the charm and warmth to keep this muso fairy tale on the tracks and there are entertaining spot-the-rocker cameos galore.,1

211065," Minding The Gap is real, raw, emotional rollercoaster ride through the awkwardness of adolescence and marks Bing Liu's directorial debut.",1
239107," Noelle fills the story with passion, debate and human contradiction. If the material ultimately eludes the director's grasp, wandering off on unfocused tangents, it's because of its ambition.",0
9820," Godard's avoidance of conventional science fiction architecture, in favour of what was actually available within Paris 1965, is his way of commenting on the city, what it was doing to its inhabitants, and what they were in danger of becoming.",1

207239, The best slasher flick I've seen in...wait...it might be the best I can remember.,1
105901," Instead of blood-soaked social commentary, it settles for a mischievous mélange of popcorn-flick set pieces -- a few of them admittedly brilliant.",1
183603," [Vargas'] story can have no happy ending, absent from political change-which is why, whatever its faults, the documentary is so effective.",1
205372, A film that's not easy to shake.,1
172223, The construction of the film is superb. [Full review in Spanish],1

167127," Late Phases transforms from laughably non-frightening horror film to self-serious family drama and back again, all the while remaining ferociously, ravenously boring.",0
158856," I chuckled once, but that lone laugh was sadly neither big nor fat.",0
51780, Lucy is that rare breed of film that is both pretentious and idiotic.,0
155527," It's quite a story, one that, like all good stories, turns out to have meaning for anyone.",1
29759," Romantic, sure, and it would have been without sinking the Titanic.",0
103271, The movie commendably and honestly spends almost as much time on Greenberg's failures as his successes.,1
68121, The movie doesn't have the energy to be truly horrible. It's too muted and enervated. But it's a somewhat tedious thing to sit through.,0

135602," Great cast, but 'mean girl' wedding comedy is mediocre.",0
119055," I don't know if Netflix got the best Sundance movie with ""Caring."" But it may have gotten the most Sundance movie.",1
171060," Ms. Theron, a true beauty and one of the screen's most exquisite actors, keeps the film airborne even when it seems dangerously earthbound. She's a one-woman emergency rescue squad.",1

94889," It's a good, solid film with soulful performances, but it isn't great.",1
166958, The film's default mode is to lazily skewer suburbanites as cartoonishly privileged yuppies. ,0
153684, Takes the viewer on an event-filled but ultimately tiresome trudge through the by-now-familiar psychosexual marshes of Lars von Trier's imagination.,0
16854," ""Ender's Game"" turns out to be a bit depressing, and I mean that in a good way.",1
138278, The movie is simply a profitable pop culture movement with the only good thing coming out of it is Beyoncé's remix of 'Crazy in Love.',0
151742," One questions how a movie this ill-conceived even got made, and how writer-director Aaron Woodley recruited a voice cast that includes talent like Susan Sarandon, Patrick Stewart and Hilary Swank.",0
136465," Playing on the ubiquitous prevalence of the Pokemon Go phenomenon, along with the popularity of horror films, this should appeal to media-obsessed Millennials...",1
80255," Impeccably shot, cast and directed, this is a truly impressive film.",1
40371," The premise isn't bad; I like the fact this hysteria happens in and around people's homes, because it's an excuse for the filmmakers to uncover secrets normally kept behind closed doors. A pity there are no great revelations here.",0

28841," Goldsman's directorial debut is decorated by an A-list cast (watch out for Will Smith, if you must), one can only assume that he has their families held hostage somewhere, because even by Colin Farrell standards, Goldsman's tale is a mawkish stinker.",0

87176, There's no end in sight. The force has awakened.,1
49425," Jones looks more like the small, impish Capote than Hoffman does -- he has the nasal whine down pat -- but his performance fails to cut as deep into the complexities of the man. Neither does the movie.",0

26468," Not a pleasant viewing experience by any stretch of the imagination, and perhaps a little too on-the-nose at times, Tyrannosaur is nonetheless a visceral roar of a debut feature from Considine.",1
20854," Fans were horrified when Sylvester Stallone managed to turn the declarative statement ""I am the law!"" into a hammy punchline. Those same folks will now be delighted to learn that Karl Urban has reclaimed the snatch of dialogue for them.",1

137667," The actors flaunt craft, the script lays on the folksiness with a trowel, and scenes of local color seem to come straight from a guidebook.",0
101926," The Miracle Worker structurally has much in common with a Western. The plot turns on a stranger who comes to town, confronts a problem the townspeople cannot solve, and leaves when that problem has been addressed.",1
57978," While the film starts out as a seemingly fresh take on the romantic comedy, it is saddled with numerous contrivances and the clichéd trappings of the genre: big weddings, wayward souls and quick-to-judge elders.",0

201621," Harsh criticism for this kiddie-focused sequel is not unwarranted, but my thought is that the film works best when not put into the Pixar context. Viewed in a vacuum, Cars 2 is solid family entertainment.",1

200748," With Bohemian Rhapsody, what we have here is a dumb and obvious film that features a number of strong performances and Queen's astounding music. It's a highly entertaining bad movie that often works in spite of itself.",0

14652, A charmless rom-com about an exhaustingly vivacious florist.,0
21516," To say ""New Year's Eve"" is cheesy is an understatement. Love struck people running around and trying to have a good time. But that is also what makes the film fun. ",1
246317, The idea of stepping into someone's life in movies is the root of entertainment and this is as close as it comes. Linklater's exquisite film is a heartbreaker and it's joyous but at its heart it's someone's life in all its aspects.,1

62899," It was a humbling reminder of, on the one hand, our insignificance, and, on the other, our disproportionately damaging impact on the planet. A sobering but significant note on which to welcome in the New Year.",1
12916, Here's a sentence I've typed before: Rebecca Hall is the best thing about this movie. The British actress raises the level of every production she touches.,1

159576," The plot's as uninteresting and flat as it sounds, a trashy send-up of the international spy thriller that chose to spoof that genre seemingly arbitrarily. But all that could be quickly forgiven with some good, solid comedy.",0
10972," Tomorrowland is meant to be uplifting, and I came out of it thoroughly depressed.",0
54605, I doubt I'll be as pleasantly and heartily amused by any other movie this summer.,1
143575, Jake Gyllenhaal should be your favorite actor.,1
106142, Just smother yourself in an inch of sunscreen. Undead cynics will be bathed in such a UV dazzling positivity that they risk imploding in their seats.,1
204148, All the good bits are in the trailer...I didn't laugh at all.,0
147212," The curiously-titled film is both a realistic war drama and a mystical fairy tale, and the styles don't always marry perfectly.",1
115193," It is completely nonsensical, not to mention frequently hilarious.",1
110301," It looks and feels like the movie you initially fell in love with, yet it offers little of the pleasure or magic that won you over in the first place. ",0
117361," Such potential, but it's neither scary nor interesting. [Full Review in Spanish] ",0
20757," Highbrow, lowbrow and no-brow, inspired by improvisation yet connected to the structure of a plot and the traditions of a genre, ""The Other Guys"" is that rare modern comedy as smart as it is crazy, and as skillful as it is silly.",1
31944," I expected a mess of epic proportions, in many ways it is (almost any scene with Depp in it), but it is bold, visionary, and truly a unique piece of blockbuster filmmaking.",1
192191, Sweet and nutty and full of the courage of its artistic convictions.,1
28618, Iron Man was a rare blockbuster that stayed with you -- the sequel all but evaporates the moment it cuts to black.,0
246791," Space Cowboys is a weirdly entertaining movie, mixing as it does Cold War intrigue, action flick and geezer buddy comedy.",1
8051," Despite its undeniable visual artistry, the latest incarnation of White Fang fails to leave a lasting indentation.",0
174461," It cavalierly toys with the history of the mechanized world, making you thankful we have luxuries like cars and electricity. But it also makes an equally solid argument that it's those luxuries we depend on that are choking the life out of our planet. ",1
160587," That fragile look Claire Danes almost always shows, the one where she's on the verge of tears from melancholy, for once meets a character worthy of wearing it.",1
151053, A special effects-laden piece of trash...,0
164099," Affleck is becoming a more skillful director with each passing project, and in terms of both technical accomplishment and entertainment value, Argo is a worthy successor to his previous films, Gone Baby Gone and The Town.",1
238101, [Submarine] is a wry coming-of-age comedy.,1
112414," It's got some interesting ideas packed inside cool cinematography and high-octane action, but those things come at the expense of plot and character development, making it a fairly typical summer popcorn movie.",0
133200, [Guiraudie] has given Stranger by the Lake a grandeur that goes beyond the anecdotal. You see it both in the expansiveness of the setting and in the faithfulness of a born filmmaker to the materials of cinema.,1
212266," Unlike the more testosterone-driven revenge fantasies of the Charles Bronson ilk, this one dares to be more complex and offers no absolution in the baptism of blood.",1
109126," Despite its technical and design finesse, this ranks as Pixar's weakest project to date, as well as the first from the animation powerhouse that can be described as craven.",0
181202," With shootout after shootout, the second Sicario film feels like it's not really going in any particular direction.",0
68700, The movie even feels cheaper than the first film. It feels more generic.,0
41669," By pumping up the darkly comedic undertones, augmenting the frigid chill of the original, Moland's terrific, riveting picture distinguishes itself from other rote remakes.",1

213566, Oscar's material in sight. Forgettable. One hit wonder. [Full review in Spanish],0

19447, It's more enriching to think about afterwards than in the moment - though it's still sometimes enriching in the moment too.,0

131880, Repo Men desperately wants to make a statement; it's just not sure what that might be.,0
206098," With guys like Linklater and White at the helm, anonymity is a tremendous disappointment, and that disappointment is really something like a compliment.",0
67547," As an attempt to kick-start a new surge of interest in the Salandar story, it is pretty hard to imagine The Girl in the Spider's Web having much luck.",0

169835, Muntean's obsessive gaze might border on the emotionally exploitative were it not accompanied by deep empathy for the plights of all involved.,1
30824," It's mostly all doom and gloom. Fans of Baumbach have come to expect that from him lately, but is it so much to ask for a good story and some likeable characters as well?",0
70," Clunky, missing engaging elements of franchise filmmaking that would make the viewer beg for a continuation. What's here is a cluttered snooze that limps to a conclusion.",0
190802," This is an epic tale sheathed in spandex, a super heroic soap opera. The Russos know how to deliver the bang, but also when to lay back.",1
40257," One of the rare films where 3D is worth the money and those ugly glasses. However, that's far from the only thing to recommend about his family-friendly - heck, human-friendly - story. ",1
192048," Basically, we're watching all of these famous names pasted onto a lot of anonymous grade-B acting and limply staged fight scenes.",0
34494," It's the perfect material for Russell, who not only deals perceptively with the dizzying swings of manic depression, but makes it the fabric of a big, generous, happy-making ensemble comedy.",1
228427," By pandering to the Avatar market's debased taste and indifference to storytelling details, this technically polished, emotionally crude remake sets back the advances that once had been made in horror movies.",0
155639, It makes you believe in the power of guilty pleasures -- suggesting in its own fanboy way that even exploding zombies can be a form of art.,1
39999, Grand Piano carries style and grace that gives the upper crust of society their own Speed-like adventure.,1
162898, Race attempts to tell two stories: about the life of Jesse Owens and the relationship between the US and Germany. Neither receives the attention it deserves.,0
159383," Starved for a laugh, the film drags on until finally the predictable life lesson is taught and the credits roll.",0
14829, Wyatt does a remarkable job of transferring the low-budget grip of his (literally) breakout flick The Escapist to the free-wheeling spirit of the summer blockbuster.,1
78159, Out of the Shadows will certainly please a whole lot of turtle fans out there.,1
134102," It's disappointing because - and maybe this is the true surprise - so much of the picture's first two-thirds are actually decent. I wouldn't call them good, but I'd call them watchable.",0
137690, Interminable and inept. ,0
137832," Theatre of the Absurd sci-fi with ""Twilight Zone"" touches, all it lacks is that tricky word that is its title -- ""Coherence""",0

155526," I appreciate [Reeves'] interest and passion on the subject, and his interview style is fine -- the conversations he finds himself engaged in with the Wachowski's especially is worth watching it for alone.",1
186345, Affable yet thoroughly forgettable...,0
185341, ...a very striking and impressive debut,1
115456," Thanks in large part to Jolie's formidable restraint, this movie isn't the star-turn showcase it might have devolved into.",1
29926, It's a hot mess. The Crimes Of Grindelwald suffers from an excess of ideas but no solid narrative to hold them together. Easily the worst film of the franchise.,0
218192," 'ShowBusiness,' a fascinating behind-the-scenes documentary about Broadway, is a special treat for people who love musicals, whether live or onscreen.",1
113522, This is definitely one of the funnier Disney films to come along in a while.,1
234312, Competent but fatally lacking in the element of surprise. [Blu-Ray],0
101797, The original movie has been debugged and rethought. It's funnier and sharper.,1
74689," It's an abjectly cruel film -- to its characters and audiences alike. Some might excuse it a arthouse cinema. Really, it's frighthouse cinema. And that's not a compliment.",0
81023, Surprisingly corny for a story that spends so much time dealing with prison and rape.,0
105224, The question that keeps returning is why a writer-director usually so canny in capturing cultural evolutions would turn so reactionary in taking on a computer-dependent society.,0
207450," What charm it does have rests largely on Highmore's shoulders. As family friendly fantasy movies go it's pretty solidly in the middle, its resolve to take no chances whatsoever keeping it from ever being more.",1
188493," Some will balk at the idea of a faith based horror film, however The Remaining successfully manages to walk the fine line between bloody-minded entertainment and religious discourse.",1
19319, Those who remember more may be hoping for more than this predictable kiddie matinee posing as savvy family entertainment.,0
10048," Annie Hall may be 40 years old this year, but it still holds up as a great romantic comedy, that is simultaneously hilarious, sweet, and at times unexpectedly sad.",1
187242, ...Pray doesn't have a passion for the material. He nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race.,1
14930," Considering a cast that also touts Ben Affleck and Wayne Newton, Smokin' Aces should have been a veritable bachelor party of guilty pleasures. It's got guns, casinos, girls, drugs and Piven.",0
200767, Put quite bluntly: Hereditary is a fiasco. [Full review in Spanish],0
10557," A highly charged drama that contains some incisive insights about working women, the corporate world, power, and sexual politics.",1
174838," The temptation to call Debra Granik's latest film, Frozen River Jr., will be great. But the longer the buzz builds for it and for Jennifer Lawrence's star-making performance, it will become abundantly clear that this is the Senior of the two films.",1
250180, A wholly generic international actioner barely distinguished by the presence of Willis's banner hero.,0
205308," Sometimes intriguing, sometimes faintly ridiculous. ",1
16894," There are many things both slapdash and screwy with Creek, but McLean's biggest sin is the 60-minute set-up before the horror kicks in.",0
211009, This is by far the best film of the year with stand out performances from Crowe and Washington. But it's not as epic as it wants to or should be.,1
189690, All told - and this film knows exactly who its audience is - a reminder of what famously enriching company habitual stoners are.,0
214751," this is a guy who is the modern master of political theater. He can drive home a point with such deadly precision, that the opposition is left blindsided and speechless.",1
73735," The Florida Project is eye-opening, unconventional, sweet, scary, odd and heartbreaking. It's a fantastic movie, one I haven't stopped thinking about since I saw it.",1
250128, Javier Bardem's sadistic fiend has got to be the most ghoulish homicidal maniac around since Jack The Ripper.,1
134664, Logan is a dark and thrilling finale for Wolverine. Director James Mangold brings stark realism to the comic genre.,1
228701, Triple 9 is undercooked.,0
94173," One can say of Mr. Gaghan, Mr. Soderbergh and Mr. Clooney that their heads may be in the right place in Syriana, but their hearts are not much in evidence as far as any emotional investment in their characters is concerned.",0
8566," It's a tacky one-joke movie, and that joke wears thin faster than a speeding bullet.",0
183058," Boyhood never allows itself to be trivial - we never see anyone buying groceries, or picking their nose, or spending their days tied to a job they don't enjoy. It's a film that's being celebrated as a triumph of realism, but it isn't like real life at all",0
49246, Insidious: The Last Key is a solid finale to the Insidious franchise that gives series lead Lin Shaye the chance to take a graceful final bow.,1
37684," Beneath the well-tuned atmospherics lurks a schlocky, ludicrous and distasteful yarn",0
232868," Children of the night, what disgusting movies they make.",0

94275, It proves that you don't need a big budget and overblown special effects to pull off a clever alien movie.,1
154453," A delightfully immersive look at how a ballet is created, Jody Lee Lipes' documentary is a stark contrast to the psycho theatrics of something like ""Black Swan.""",1

173237," Monroe's measured performance anchors a strong cast that overcomes occasional doldrums, confirming the stardom conferred by It Follows and The Guest.",1

144442," Too often, The Nice Guys feels like the Funniest Film of 1994. There are worse things.",1
103094, Kevin James' average-Joe appeal doesn't go very far in a film that's noticeably low on charm or playfulness. ,0
153642," Not exactly politically correct, but you'd be hard pushed to find a single mean frame.",1
236925," The film... is beautifully visualized and steadfastly interesting, yet I kept wondering why I didn't feel more involved in it.",0
235082," You don't have to be a second coming of Albert Einstein to figure out how it will all end, but that doesn't stop Shrek Forever After from having a tremendous amount of heart.",1
230234, A coming-of-age tale as vibrant and whimsical as it is overstuffed and fragmented.,1
218467," Ultimately, it's a competent, if uninspired, chronicle of an intriguing community hamstrung by that worthily reverential approach that afflicts British film-makers.",0
30677, Zoolander fans will love every minute of this movie. The rest of us can wait until it comes out on video.,0
83103," The documentary is predictable, stylistically stolid and about as focused as a pellet-gun blast.",0
133544, With Private Ryan the object is to put you in a place no sane person would choose to go. And it does.,1
132592, One of the true gems of film noir.,1
243346," This is one of the best films of 2014, even though liberals and pacifists will hate the political message it sends. But politics aside, the craftsmanship of this film is flawless.",1
170856," Acts as a timely and potent reminder that those with creative impulses can engage in political discourse and address the disenfranchised through other, equally effective channels.",1
201045," Maguire reveals most of his shortcomings as an actor here. Whenever he shares a scene with someone as solid as Banks, Linney or Haysbert, it's as if he disappears. ",0
239151," While Jennifer Lawrence excels in the title role, the film becomes a muddled domestic chore as it bogs down in dysfunctional family squabbling.",0
235061," Energising, stylish and engrossing, although its scattershot chronology and egocentric approach might not be to everyone;s taste.",1
218694," As far as great science fiction cinema goes, Garland's latest ranks up there as one of the most ambitious and audacious offerings we've seen grace the big screen in the last few years. ",1
43279," I wanted to enjoy Dylan Dog: Dead of Night, if only because films of this ilk are rarely produced anymore. However, it's a bust. An extraordinarily talky, tedious, unmonstery bust.",0
85215," The metaphorical force of this conceit-insisting on the artifice of the social world that frowns on rapture-is not hard to grasp, but its frailty unsettles some of the actors.",0
22516," Besides the pedestrian nature of the writing and crudeness of its humor, the film has a huge problem -- its ""heroes"" are often unsympathetic.",0
116350," Despite a sharp cast and lots of stentorian speechifying, Mary Queen of Scots joins the ranks of the dull.",0
235814, The Imitation Game is a fantastic piece of historical theater that never fully embraces its cinematic identity.,1
170808, a Platonic dialogue in that it's suspiciously like a monologue disguised as an exchange.,1
208959," Glowering from beneath the bangs of her moonbeam-platinum bob, Theron's Broughton is equal parts air, light and iron. We're just the moths clustering around her flame.",1
126815," As with all Agatha Christie stories, the solution to the mystery is rather ingenious. You may or may not see that solution ahead of time, but it hardly matters. The real joy in her work are the questions rather than the answer.",1
172821, A cheerfully inoffensive cinematic bauble that may be no more durable than a tree ornament but should charm the parents and kids who will flock to it.,1
99046, But both variations on Melinda's story bear the unmistakable mark of Allen's morose sensibilities. In the end they both feel muddy and unfocused rather than delightfully ambiguous.,0

66088," If you didn't see this in a theater, you cheated. And cheated yourself. ",1
178191," It needed a star like the Russell Crowe of ""Gladiator"" to provide dramatic heft. What is ""Ben-Hur"" without a platform of moral grandeur? Not much.",0
79515," Well, there's a bizarre fascination to it all.",1
237479, To a large extent it's coasting on goodwill from the previous film - but the previous film established a lot of goodwill to coast on.,1

59335, McDonagh's dialogue is often bruisingly funny -- particularly once hambone Ralph Fiennes makes his belated entrance -- and his sense of the absurd never falters.,1
224697," Star Trek fans like their philosophy deep, and Nemesis, the 10th big-screen episode, does not disappoint.",1
65809," Despite some lofty intentions, McHenry (who last directed the melodramatic Jason's Lyric) more or less keeps it sitcom superficial.",0
251113," Jolie has a knack for picking out small details, but as a director she is captivated more by the story's elemental sweep than its human components. ",0

128439," Unpretentious and scary, with a crack ensemble of kids led by future Amy Adams, Sophia Lillis.",1
230723," Anywhere else but in this movie, Woody's quest would evidence a high level of dementia. ""Nebraska"" is far too precious to entertain that notion. ",0
136471," Anvil: The Story of Anvil is a brilliant real-life Spinal Tap, with as much pathos as laughs.",1
246784," The execution may not be there, but at least it has good intentions. Then again, you know what they say about the road to hell.",0

235909, Step Up 3D features superb 3D effects and suitably impressive dance sequences but it fails to connect on an emotional level...,0
39742, Moving so quickly its flaws barely register -- the blockbuster equivalent of sleight-of-hand -- Now You See Me fares best when simply relying on the no-illusions chemistry between its leads.,1
50910," It's a chase film, it's a buddy film, it's a ridiculous, loud and often offensive romp. Witherspoon's character is cornball and annoyingly adrenalized - what was she thinking?",0
164237, Generic last-couple-on-Earth sci-fi that's too empty to offer anything deep or fun. ,0
247644," Despite being entirely unrealistic, this is a mildly entertaining movie thanks to its breezy tone and a cast that seems to be having a good time.",0

246139, A beautiful piece of filmmaking with top notch acting...,1
227067," Suffice it to say that for about half its running time, the story earns goodwill with believable depictions of love both found and lost. It loses all that later in the game when it patently stops being honest and starts being Hollywood.",0
86080, An extremely violent mess of a movie. ,0
196534," An alternately kooky and kinky comedy about the impossibility of establishing a science of romance, the movie is salvaged from small screen sitcomish attitude by the enormous warmth and vivacious personality of Vardolos, even when in pretend tyrant mode.",1

18967," Once The Theory Of Everything reaches this transitional period of Hawking's storied career, the film immediately rights itself from its wonky beginnings.",1
162149," From the moment our gilded couple hove into view in one of the most beautiful cars ever made -- a convertible Citroën DS -- I have to say I rather warmed to it, despite its obvious lack of commerciality.",1
177387," While I can certainly marvel at the realistic computerized water in a movie, I don't go to the movies to marvel at computerized water. ",0
68043," Formally and visually it is a work of real craftsmanship, and it displays a conscious understanding of the paradoxes of the heart that the horror genre plumbs so well.",1
62547," An odd, dispassionate religious film that will likely be more powerful for skeptics than true believers, it manages to most strongly suggest the possibility of grace by so clinically observing its opposite.",1
180869, Nothing is at it seems in this film and that makes it an absolute must-see.,1
24310," Basically a duplication of the 2013 original, with absolutely no thought and energy put into creating anything unique or genuine.",0
31170," Too inept to work as what it seems to be, and not clever enough to work as a spoof -- which, if you're feeling charitable, is what you assume they intended.",0

25366, Iron Man 3 defies typical third-chapter drop-off and makes it clear that the franchise is in good hands with its new director.,1
19467," A knotty mess, but not quite dismissable either.",0
139575," Its feminist comedic pointers often times come across as a checklist of items writers would like to gender swap, as opposed to instinctive developments in the story. ",0
163882," Engaging enough, although not entirely satisfying from either a genre or narrative standpoint, lacking both substance and a degree of imagination.",0
91567," Bullock sells her part of the film, and Church throws in some good, hearty laughs, but ultimately, this is just an ""eh.""",0
247109," Shot and styled in contemporary, ticking-clock action fashion, it compresses the complex Theatcher-era politics of its fractious standoff into a simplified West-versus-Middle-East conflict that registers as broadly topical.",1
185230," What we have here, essentially, is not the final grand statement to an overarching narrative but merely a Glass that's half empty, half full (of itself).",0
66077," Many of the movement's goals are unmet and many of its accomplishments are fragile, but it's still eye-opening to contrast the attitudes and expectations from 40 years ago with those of today.",1
45315," Of all the movies about drug trafficking, and the authorities who battle the problem, I would rate ""Sicario"" somewhere in the middle. It is extremely violent, of course, but only intermittently suspenseful. ",1

107375," The perverse humor and outrageous scenarios made me laugh often enough to recommend the movie, but I'm disappointed that it didn't explore the potential in an R-rated body-swap comedy more carefully.",1
17646, The Sisters Brothers is one of the hidden gems of 2018. It holds a great artistic value and it's still a lot of fun to watch.,1

221152," The movie ought to be scarier, but in the current genre environment of teen-centric, found-footage shockers, its messing-with-Mother Nature traditionalism and structured storytelling is so old-school it feels new again.",1
158036, A delirious satire of British jihadists.,1
63949," This innocuous flick tries to evoke screwball rom-coms of the '40s, but despite a few chuckles, it misfires with predictable plotting and forced farce.",0

66708, Wally Pfister's film tries to ask big questions but isn't smart enough to answer them.,0

205385, It spends way too much time on the antics of Buster and his slacker sidekick in a plotline that kids won't get and parents won't enjoy.,0
235899," The star of the show is undoubtedly Clooney, who delivers one of his best performances.",1
237741," Thanks to its skilful director, well-cast actors and talented technical team, this fiercely entertaining British horror movie has blood, guts and brains.",1
18850," In a sort of backhanded answer to Pixar's The Incredibles (and I mean that in a positive way), DreamWorks hits yet another animated adventure out of the park. Megamind is clever, fast-paced and fun, and looks fantastic in 3D.",1

245880, What's truly great about Keanu is that it rises above being just an action-thriller version of parody franchise Scary Movie. Key & Peele have actually made an action movie in its own right-except it stars a kitten and a pair of black nerds.,1
148802," With battle scenes that are obscenely gruesome and pacing that is too slow, the film lumbers along like a Buick in the mud.",0
116809," For all the action -- and there's plenty of it, even if it's only a portion of what was crammed into Rowling's 870 pages -- the most important stuff is what takes place in Harry's head.",1

224371, I doubt that anyone who isn't well familiar with slasher movie tropes will completely understand all the jokes... but they should at least get a couple laughs out of it.,1
23488," A wall-to-wall delight peppered with gags for adults, Spongebob 2 absolutely holds up to a second viewing.",1
67828," The action, however spirited in its manic creativity, is so relentlessly repetitive that it ceases to be as cool as the director plainly imagines it to be a very long time before the end of the movie .",0
157394," A very enjoyable middle-of-the-road adventure, especially for moviegoers willing to see just about anything starring Rudd.",1

123090, So adeptly does it roll sugar rush and brain freeze into one that it might as well come served in a paper cone.,1

27904, ...easily one of the best horror films I have ever seen.,1
205312, Outlaw Kingis a fair stab - all puns intended - at the Robert the Bruce story.,1
41799," Jackie Chan is credited as ""Excetutive Producer"" [sic] in the opening credits. That pretty much tells you the amount of effort that went into this film, because Bleeding Steel is one of the worst films in Jackie Chan's career.",0
66966," More successful as an exercise in style than storytelling, the circular narrative collapsing in on itself at the last.",0

122718," Unfortunately, they didn't get the story right. The first three-quarters of the film is very predictable. And, despite a couple of nice twists in the last act, it's not enough to counterbalance that predictability.",0
138908," Fatally compromised (but) ambitious and clever... It reminds us of the way majority America treats black men in particular, with a humiliating mistrust that's never far behind the admiration expressed for those who 'earn' approval through their talents...",0

194461," Zodiac, the latest film from director David Fincher, is among his best",1

95016," If Raimi continues in this direction, he might be well on his way to the greatest superhero trilogy of all time.",1
90310," Wild Target is a poorly directed, badly written comedy thriller that wastes a talented cast and fails to provide anything resembling laughs or thrills.",0
32342," Bret Easton Ellis Tweeted about the awfulness of this movie. Le Carre vs. Ellis -- considering that's the mental and literary equivalent of a brawl between Godzilla and Jar Jar Binks, I'd say it's safe for discerning viewers to give this a shot.",1

12765, Mr. Shaloub injects some much needed energy into the film which otherwise feels long at two hours.,1
193255," What the film does well is to immerse us in the tragic weirdness of wartime logic, where nothing works as we would expect. It's a strong, engaging film about how hard it is to wage peace.",1
244757," Measured against the relatively high bars of other recent superhero fare, it feels uncomfortably familiar. For those looking for a slice of high-flying entertainment, however, it certainly suffices.",1

79281, Ejiofor creates a realistic backdrop for the movie's central story.,1
142115," But the film's appeal lies not so much in the confirmation of Phoenix's acting abilities, but rather in the excellent chemistry that exists between the latter and an unrecognizable Jonah Hill. [Full review in Spanish]",1
122612," Fascinating drama with DeNiro as psycho, talk show wannabe, and Jerry Lewis giving great performance.",1
146837," ...a tense thriller set in Soviet Russia in 1953...tightly directed with surprisingly good pace...fine performances, especially by Hardy, Rapace, and Oldman...exceptional dark and forbidding cinematography enhanced by understated music.",1

89554," In all of Maud's unfailingly cheerful oeuvre, Walsh found she never painted a self-portrait. Maudie is the result of the director's desire to fill that gap.",1

29601," No one is going to be talking about this film when awards season rolls around next time. But chances are good that you'll leave the theater with a smile on your face. Considering the real-life subject matter, maybe that's worthy of a prize.",1
34614," Chronicles their 30-year history in a style befitting the band: bare-bones, frank, nonsensationalized and adamantly unsentimental.",1
56939, Chock-full of the kind of power moments that are extremely useful in assembling a trailer. But the filmmakers forgot something: a good story to hold the celebrity bric-a- brac and shtick together.,0
28218, A film titled Eat Pray Love should at least capture a spiritual experience and offer romance with some sizzle. This felt more like Eat Grieve Befriend.,0
13497," The movie's delights unfold like an intricate, exotic puzzle: Winterbottom has built a detailed, miniature universe inside a sugar egg.",1
233338," It is a layered, witty, enlightening assault on conventions and preconceptions, a crackling palimpsest that challenges as it entertains.",1
184576," It's a strange film, one that was hard for me to warm up to.",0
84749," All play well together under the direction of Jodie Foster, who keeps a tight rain on the production and doesn't self indulge by drawing everything out - the film is a crisp hour and a half.",1
186487," ""Together, these young actors generate all the excitement of a laundry spin cycle. Thank God for Jeff Goldblum.""",0
119134," Too much of the same old same old here at the end of summer; the plot of this one is too similar to ""Turbo"" which got there first.",0

37053," Excellent acting all around ensures that emotions run hot, but this is Loach at his most earnest and elegant.",1
81369," A fine film boasting some notably detailed period recreation...As a historical drama about how a nation looked to a single person for its cue about how to react to the murder of its leader the film does make for a solid, if somewhat repetitive, journey.",1
190936, Shorts jumps right over the line between energetic and frenzied and zooms right on by.,0
211118," There isn't anything breathtaking about it and a lot of it feels like we're following the same beaten path, but James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan seem to make the best of their cheesy lines and talk about destiny. ",1
130181," It's not all bad. But there are wasted, senseless scenes of characters about to head to the Quidditch pitch for a game that doesn't happen and time-eating speeches about how ""This could mean the end of Hogwarts"" (Crikey, again?)",0
184237, It melodramatizes everything and yet its overall effect is something more than melodrama.,1
249733," The lack of originality is offset by sheer silliness, including Classified and Skipper's Abbott and Costello-style argument over whether there's a long I in ""diversion."" The word fits the movie.",1
156643," This unique, super-smart and berserkly imaginative French animated entry is a real achievement in the world of animation.",1

126252," The jokes are, on paper, funny. On screen they just seem like the inevitable, the only thing to say, and their zing zags off into bland, familiar territory... the material didn't coalesce past pointing at something funny and saying, ""hey, that's funny al",0

141561, A half-baked little movie that proves indies can be every bit as boringly formulaic and artistically bankrupt as their big-budget brethren.,0
139025," At best, Serenity could turn into a cult film because of how spectacularly inept it is. [Full Review in Spanish]",0
124219," a film about honor, love and loyalty that transcends its subject matter and can connect to a larger audience if they give it a chance",1

204483," Life Of Pi must be the most beautiful film of the year, a technical marvel, and magic realism at its most magical.",1
193446," First and foremost, ""The Green Fog"" is a marvel of film scholarship that looks backward and forward from the Hitchcock masterpiece.",1
138513, A bland love story that features a twist that feels more like a dupe.,0

67176, [T]his sweet-tempered adaptation is a film that parents and kids can enjoy together.,1
122973, [Streep's] performance overpowers the movie it's in - a perfectly executed triple axel that renders everything else just featureless ice.,0

170219, The movie is in stunning 3D but it is the 4th dimension -- heart -- where it truly excels.,1
176068," The ingredients seem perfect: a stellar cast, an unassailable soundtrack and source material from a proven hit. Somehow, though, this sugary mix turns into a sour hairball that will have you gagging to expel it for 108 minutes.",0
95375," Ferrell, in need of a shorter leash, never makes the character any more than a caricature, and Kidman, in a rare comedic role, suffers, too.",0
242087, A sturdy-enough recounting of the famous Holocaust Death Camp revolt story blessed with a riveting third act. ,1
49906," An entertaining wartime period piece; Cotillard is a knockout, Pitt less believable. While the London-set sections are more interesting, the louche glamour of Casablanca is hard to beat for allure, mystique and pure spectacle. ",1

5706," Enjoyable, confidently executed and well-played, though there may be more than a touch of the Tony Blairs about Sheen's Clough.",1
222638," It's a brave directorial endeavor from Tykwer and the Wachowskis. That they could piece together a coherent picture is a testament to their skill, while the sheer scale of the effort celebrates their endearingly daredevil appetites.",1
8077," Redford, Nolte, and co. want us to leave with a profound sense of self and inspiration, they leave us instead with a fairly fun buddy-comedy in the woods. Still, it's worth the walk.",0
239924," Unfortunately, Loktev's dry approach to establishing the couple's relationship means its abrupt collapse causes little emotional impact.",0
139572," It's academic Pop Art, overblown but zestless, a cartoon cathedral with all the spiritual feeling of a Little Golden Book.",0

206645," For many, Jackson's ""Hobbit"" will look like an overly long amusement-park attraction. But for fantasy fans who have dreamed all their lives of spending time inside Tolkien's dazzling alternative reality, it's a ride well worth taking.",1
72460," Stevens visibly relishes every second of his blue-eyed bad boy's screen-time; it's a brilliantly perverse casting coup enhanced by Barrett's devilish dialogue, while Wingard directs with flamboyance and precision.",1
90531," Whatever definition of ""dope"" you prefer, it applies to Rick Famuyiwa's movie. Dope is a drug caper involving teenagers doing stupid things for the geeks they are, the kind John Hughes might have written if he allowed black people in his movies.",1

219434, Social commentary mingles with stupid comedy in this humorless update of a 1977 George Segal-Jane Fonda romp.,0
110871," The film's sources maintain impressive composure in relating the repeated obstructions, sophistries, and obfuscations they faced, but their frustration is palpable.",1
2740," Unlike How to Train Your Dragon 2, which gives us characters older, wiser, and more experienced than they were in the previous movie, Too pretty much reprises all the conflicts from last time.",0

135803," This is a moving and provocative film that initially unsettles, then disturbs and finally haunts you well into the night.",1
181055," As a whole, Oh Lucy! is an inventive story that's remarkably relatable. What makes the sympathetic Setsuko so wonderfully charming is a combination of Atsuko Hirayanagi's story and direction and Shinobu Terajima's endearing performance.",1

140155," Try to see this amazingly visual and immersive film on the largest screen possible. And yes, it will help to see the original first. The world is beautiful, layered and fascinating and the characters keep you caring every one of its 164 minutes. ",1
181995," This brilliant docu is not just a portrait of a compulsive artist, but also a deep inquiry into the mysteries of art, creativity, mental illness and family bind.",1
104561," It might have been more interesting if Raimi had attempted to shoot an ""Oz"" prequel using only the tools available to Victor Fleming and King Vidor in the late 1930s.",0
138555," Watchmen may be another comic-book blockbuster but, at its best moments, it's also a refreshingly provocative head trip.",1

219647," I suppose that fans of horror films might like this, but I sure could not see any point to it.",0
52159," While it never quite enters the realm of horror, Coppola knowingly conjures something supernatural about what drives these women in the shaded margins of America's bloodiest war.",1
174609," The film takes on Gabrielle's listlessness, slumps into an opiated fug. The malady is mysterious and not easily treatable. It just exhausts you.",0

62105, I was really looking forward to this one.,0
69488," In the wake of the ostentatious atmospherics summoned by the likes of Shutter Island and American Horror Story: Asylum, the film feels unnecessarily restrained. ",0
60017," Ignorant, culturally insensitive and unfunny, this is simply the equivalent of a Wiggles concert for the ``I love shoes'' set.",0
221445, Leave[s] us mourning a great character and wondering where that talent might have brought her. Essential.,1
24494, You don't have to wear a yarmulke or even be Jewish to be affected by this traumatic story of religious intolerance.,1
30700," The audience, in all likelihood, will be so grateful not to see another joyless, inert, pea green dud that it may not mind that The Incredible Hulk is just a luridly reductive and violent B movie -- one that clears a bar that hadn't been set very high.",1
206082, A new generation adopts my generation's horror films,0
148252, Viewing the film in IMAX 3D was less an experience than an endurance test.,0
111438," Watching Minions is like watching a spastic colon spew little yellow turds at you. It's less a movie than a brand strategy meeting, all the way through.",0
244172," If you have ever taken a moment to wonder what a vampire romance directed by Jim Jarmusch would look like, then Only Lovers Left Alive probably comes pretty close to the film you imagined.",1
154475, This asinine romantic comedy doesn't have an original bone in it's body.,0
19429," Coppola...tugs at that feeling of weightlessness you get when you're in a foreign country, the sense of discovery but also the solitude",1
173148, A strangely grim indoctrination into the politics of victimization.,0
78067," Too mucky and uneven to signify an out-and-out winner, but...charming when it wants to be and not nearly as bad as early word has suggested.",0
96863," More than a featurette or biography, it's a companion piece that shows precisely how real people can be heroes right alongside the fictional ones they create, just by learning how to be themselves and living that truth.",1
95190," Ironically, for a film series that's about magic, this lost all sense of magic and whimsy.",0
37897, Heroes get their moment in Matthew Heineman's absorbing documentary.,1
186314," In its attempts to debunk the feasibility of massive energy reduction, Pandora's Promise at least brings some measure of rhetorical skill to its arguments.",0
208849," Despite some graphic violence to mar the film, if you can hang in for the shamefully slow first half, the last 40 minutes is entertaining.",0
210225," The approach results in one scene of heart-in-throat action after another, with Chandor's immersive approach shoring up Redford's remarkable, understated performance.",1
50376," This has its visually wondrous moments, and the lead (Lewis MacDougall) is a true find, but there's too much bark, too little bite.",0
186834," Bugsy Malone is like nothing else. It's an original, a charming one, and it has yet another special performance by Jodie Foster, who at thirteen was already getting the roles that grown-up actresses complained weren't being written for women anymore. ",1
225990," Mission: Impossible - Fallout is full of outrageous stunts, exotic locales, an engrossing plot and nerve-shredding tension.",1
179249, The bleak comedy of the film's first half gives way to a more sombre mood in the second. ,1
228607," Insufferable. Chow Yun-Fat still needs a good American movie, but is time slipping away?",0
185719, Surrogates is yet another film that got swallowed by the Hollywood machine and spit out the other side. It's a surrogate of itself.,0
71589," Bay['s] view of the military is blatantly sentimental... Yet when it comes to the combat scenes, and to the nerve-shredding suspense sequences leading up to them, he is stunningly effective. ",1
44409," Woefully under-written, relying too much on the juxtaposition of profanity and puppets for easy laughs and getting bogged down in the straightforward film noir plot, which could have used more satire.",0
7325," Wildly disjointed, with a plot and tone that are all over the map and character motivations that don't make a lick of sense.",0
120870," It tries to be everything to all people, with its young star (to attract to tweenies), copious mayhem (startling at times) and hard-boiled characters but only succeeds in part.",1
214305, Reese Witherspoon saves this lightweight film from falling into the bottomless pit of meaningless sequels.,1
110082," One day, I feel sure, the rich mantle of charisma will descend upon [Hayden Christensen], but Jumper is not that occasion.",0
112896," But Black Panther was a moment, not just for Marvel fans and Disney stans, but it was the rare instance of a film purporting itself to be a cultural movement, and succeeding.",1
244880," With an incredible performance by Garret Dillahunt and great supporting work by Monica Potter, Sara Paxton, Tony Goldwyn, and others, Last House is the best mainstream horror movie in a long time.",1
34802," Despite the meticulousness of Haynes's adaptation, the complexity of Therese's attitude is lost, and with it much of the strange energy and ambiguous pleasures of Highsmith's inimitable book.",0
158354," A ridiculous movie, packed full of ridiculous commentary.",0
61050, A sweet and slight and often charming coming-of-age tale.,1
186157," One thing Power mostly gets right is that he spends enough time with both the predators and their victims, separately, so that you start to care for the latter even if you don't fully understand the motivations of the former.",1
116649, Plain-faced moralizing... It's at once bold and dumbed down.,0
144077," A misbegotten, would-be franchise-starter that only the most diehard players of Blizzard Entertainment's series will likely get any true enjoyment out of.",0
228424," Without Swinton, often seen in close-up, the film might have sunk without trace under the weight of its morbid subject matter. But she is pitch perfect throughout, restrained but still forceful.",1
187269," It's a sweet, slight romantic comedy with appealing stars and a happy ending -- unless you're a fan of, you know, that other team.",1
171341," Like looking at a black light poster on uppers: It's visually lovely, and you're having a good time, but there's also a small nagging sense that somebody might have brought the wrong drugs to the party.",1
138977," Tries to cram in as many plot points as possible to fill its belly with caloric melodrama. It's a diluted journey of feminine self-realization, better with bruises and teamwork than it is with pliable matters of the heart.",1
132811," A mostly static excursion with a weak premise when it comes to explaining what went wrong with the planet, and an even weaker remedy offered for making it right again.",0
121566, Director Josh Trank does an impressive job of capturing the elation of three young men in the ecstatic throes of discovering they literally can do just about anything.,1
180247," An attempt to make a live-action nature film with the same sort of emotional wallop as the legendary 1994 animated smash ""The Lion King,"" ""African Cats"" was doomed to come off as phony.",0
153615," The Tarantino style has been copied a thousand times over since Pulp Fiction, what Kill Bill: Vol. 2 proves is that he's still the master.",1
153154," It's a film whose final shape feels dwindled by compromise - not unappealing, but stymied, like a luxury jet which spends two hours taxiing on the runway.",0
229533," Despite the degree of control Ramsay exercises, what's likely to stick with you...is the portrait Miller draws of unfathomable malice and Swinton of tortured incomprehension.",1
220138," A technical marvel that's packed to the margins with details and tricks, pathos and inside jokes, Toy Story 2 fulfills the immense promise of its predecessor where it might have diminished its charms.",1
64330," Think of it as one long ""Looney Tunes"" cartoon with a few funny sequences that have little to do with the crowded, though admittedly sweet story. Just remember, we've already seen most of the real hilarity in those ubiquitous movie trailers.",1
165861," Although a tad sappy and heavy-handed at times, Mary and Max fidgets and wiggles its way into our good spirits by the time it reaches its endearing conclusion.",1
45497," For nearly three hours, Springsteen jokes, rails, wails, and yes, plays his heart out, providing an achingly raw, often disarmingly honest breakdown of his life.",1
78916," As a brutish action movie in the John Carpenter vein, the film has certain inalienable rights: it's allowed to be crudely satirical and cheaply lurid. It achieves this quite entertainingly, though it's not entitled to drag on for as long as it does.",1
114325," Buried somewhere in this movie is an interesting concept, but the delivery lacks imagination and suspense, and the plot is largely predictable.",0
177400," By its climax of sorts, it's clear the film may be a goof on Rodrigues' part, but good thing it's at least funny enough to not just sustain, but build its laughs to the very end.",1
91672, the plot keeps getting in the way of the humor,0
151419, The movie is just as much a glorification of Hamer and the Texas Marshalls as its predecessor was of Bonnie and Clyde. ,0
131525, Inspirational misfire about a guy seeking redemption by helping complete strangers has Will Smith in his grimmest role and his sloppiest movie. Whether his name can help this confusing film will be a big test of his star power.,0
216626, Casting Silverstone as the princess gives final proof of Branagh's temporary (one hopes) insanity.,0
200404," This is one of those mystery thrillers that are supposed to culminate in a big shocker ending, though the script piles up so many implausibilities that by the time the ending arrives, nothing is surprising anymore.",0
75098," Even in its measured pacing, the film easily commands attention.",1
146795," Beyond being a great new interpretation of a classic novel, Jane Eyre is a superb second feature from Fukunaga, a director who's on track to becoming a major contemporary filmmaker.",1
222513," ""My Life in Ruins"" is a stellar romantic comedy where ancient history and love meet.",1
225896, The script doesn't work hard enough to make Vincent more than a one-dimensional grouch.,0
87856," A film of a strong surreal and metaphorical tone, with nurses dressed in an old fashioned way experimentating on children in an operating room that resembles a morgue. [Full review in Spanish]",1
151," Intended as an ode to the power of words, 'Letter' is rarely worth listening to, let alone watching, and matters aren't helped by slice-and-dice editing that sometimes makes you wonder if the camera started rolling in mid-scene...",0
196005," A spectacular, breathtaking, pulse-racing work of pop art.",1
158423," Rough around the edges, scrappy and and yet still illuminating documentary about Oscar-winning actor Olympia Dukakis. ",1

66750," I hope Snyder had fun, because it might be a few decades before he gets another shot.",0
66428," The story is remarkable and profound, however the way the tale has been presented and told is too cliched, devaluing the poignancy attached to this narrative. ",0
13324," ""The Measure of a Man' poses an important question - what are we losing as humans in a world that champions financial profit above all?",1
32984, The beauty of Hurt's complex performance is the helplessness in his eyes as his mouth spews its poisonous cruelty - he's a hostage to what used to be wit but now just feels like petty spite.,1
184339," The whole plot has about as much mystery as a performance on a pole, but it's the brief encounters with believable disaster that give the movie its winning character. Sure, it's hokey and pat, but Patti and Jheri are fantastic... ",1
59728, A United Kingdom is a very likeable film about two very admirable people.,1
167013," This is a one-joke movie, but it sustains that joke pretty decently throughout. Ironically, zombie fans are likely to be more outraged than Austen fans.",1
197951," It is also significant to note that it places a deserved recurring spotlight onto the scene's women and LGBTQ punk artists, as well as the inclusive attitudes of those who found themselves building a flourishing punk scene...",1
175585, A chunky and clunky romantic-comedy wannabe.,0
76480," A confident drama about a real-life 1976 political scandal, this Swedish film is expertly tells the story from three fascinating angles.",1

168519," The movie invites a measure of cynicism - which it proceeds to obliterate with a 93-minute blast of color, noise, ingenuity and fun.",1
40787," You never know where ""The Shape of Water"" is going. But, like water, you let it engulf you and sweep you away.",1
34165," If Test can portray a dark time with an underlying sense of hope for the future, it's because almost thirty years later, looking back at 1985, it has no ambivalence about the progress that's occurred since.",1
217658," Revolting Rhymes Part One (UK) is based on a Roald Dahl book, and has plenty of the subversive, wry humor you'd expect from the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda.",1
127486," The actors who form the skate crew were all skaters in Los Angeles. Jonah Hill strove for authenticity everywhere throughout the film, and it's 100% apparent in the choices he made.",1
181818, Allies is presented as a romantic drama. But eventually it seems to going nowhere. [Full review in Spanish],0
182964," Wonder Woman does something special: It gets real. In a genre sometimes overly fond of black-and-white heroes and villains, this film forces its heroine to confront moral grays.",1
92143," A few more films like these, and this will be remembered as the beginning of the end of his blockbuster career.",0
47206," Duncan and Broadbent are wonderful, especially Duncan, whose eyes alone could educate an entire drama school.",1
51647," Despite the fact that there's a lot of technique on display here, the film still described as cinéma vérité, which I suppose is a testament to how raw and emotional it all feels.",1
65205," In the '70s, this would've been an unusually intimate tour portrait. Now, it's a newly unearthed time capsule, the remarkable clarity of Blank's portrait compounded by the distance from which we're looking at it.",1
106445, Certain Women more than justifies itself as a serious argument for the beauty of the small and intimate drama and the importance of female-driven filmmaking.,1
98155," The movie Haggis made and the movie Elah could have been are as far apart as Washington, D.C., and Baghdad.",0
46649, There's plenty here to intrigue and eventually terrify thanks to a script that keeps us guessing about what really has unfolded above ground.,1
163574," What ""City of Ghosts"" does best is to humanize those who've suffered most from the conflict in Syria, educating us through both outrage and compassion.",1
89982, It should have been great but it just doesn't have enough magic dust to fly.,0
29158," The plot of Labor Day would make a great Upworthy article. Let me suggest a title: ""I Never Thought I'd Want My Mom to Love a Murderer Until I Met This Bloody Hunk."" ",0
232781," Though not as endearing as the first film or funny as the second, Despicable 3 achieves what it sets out to - entertain the kids.",1
51882," Hey, no Twilight vegan, goody-two-shoes crap here. At least this vampire sucks. Unfortunately, so does much of his movie",0
204076," A case of a missed opportunity. It references all the right films, but The Snowman comes off as a pale imitation.",0
25529," In a World... is far from perfect and doesn't quite have the laser-focus of a more seasoned writer and director, but even the most awkward and fumbling moments of the film are a joy to watch and experience.",1
199177," Lemon Tree offers no solution to the ancient struggles of ownership in the West Bank, but it shines a tender, humane light on the individual lives it continues to disrupt.",1
201782, Guy Ritchie's take on Arthurian myth is a misbegotten mash-up of sword-and-sorcery action fantasy and geezers-on-a-mission caper. It's all booming CGI and lairy banter. Bish bash bosh! ,0
139417, The horror genre is blessed to welcome another innovative female director who is telling stories and rebelling against the traditional gaze-pushing the envelope and experimenting in true artistic fashion.,1
196286," All of the pieces are in place as the film fades to black, but our journey along the way is a little too mechanical to be a genuine crowd pleaser.",1
198094," The overarching mood is self-congratulation, which no doubt helps the sugary medicine of lifestyle fantasy go down.",0
50369," Despite all these negative aspects, the movie falls smack down the middle of 'you get what you paid for' territory. This allows you to push logic out of the building (pun intended) and savour the mayhem as it unfolds.",1
151991," What crowns the movie, flourishing the fullness of its purpose, is color.",1
151986, Too stupefyingly dull to compete with Mommie Dearest on the midnight movie circuit. ,0
219651," Red Sparrow isn't a good movie, and that's too bad, because you can see what it might have been. The story has intrigue built into it in a way that probably made perfect sense on the page; it just doesn't translate onto the big screen.",0
65852," Sorry, but the late reward hardly justifies all that punishment.",0
75792," [Cornish gives] a great performance, and it's disappointing that the movie around her isn't worthy of it.",0
24828," A few moments here and there are admittedly funny, but they alone can't carry the flick that otherwise feels uninspired. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)",0

162565," Sofia Coppola's radical re-envisioning of Don Siegel's lurid 1971 Civil War melodrama works in the same way as Hendrix covering Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"" or Johnny Cash singing Nine Inch Nails' ""Hurt."" ",1
168548," Some of Suleiman's symbols are maddeningly obtuse, while others -- like the final shot of a pressure cooker -- are ridiculously obvious.",0
33291," In 2015, Nemes made a film about one of history's most incomprehensible atrocities and was heavily awarded for it. This time, he seems to have cut out the middleman and made a film that serves nothing so much as his own ego.",0
162594," The Swedish trilogy trundles to a wobbly finale that's heavy on plot and cheap theatrics, but light on the dark, mesmerizing energy that made the first film so watchable.",0
66037," The movie is sweet, amusing and, unlike one of Child's decadent platters of beef bourguignon, mostly weightless; if not for Streep's expert portrayal, which is boundlessly energetic and respectful, it might float off the screen.",0
222348," ...while a good part of the picture reached my submerged Stooges person and made him laugh, too much of it just didn't connect at all.",0
184158," The movie is never boring or uninteresting, but I viewed it from a detached perspective, unable to become involved because I didn't really care about any of the three main characters.",0
81886," The ensuing decades have brought forth a deluge of bogus masterpieces, and Fellini's, by comparison, holds up rather well.",1
111781, His latest offering is as vibrant as any he has produced.,1
248594," This film is delightful, funny nonsense that had me laughing out loud.",1
213096," Its foreign antecedent bore the moniker Reykjavik-Rotterdam, but perhaps mindful that many Americans would mistake these two major European cities for brands of beer, the action has been switched to New Orleans-Panama. ",0
120254," [Swanberg] points the movie in directions that defy our expectations, exploring the characters' immaturity and the entropy of human interaction.",1
36873," Estrangement is a portrait of a broken society told in microcosmic form, but it is at its most potent in exploring very ordinary horrors.",1
15131," It's a smart, nasty picture, reinvigorating stale screenwriting ingredients -- a delirious valentine to slasher archetypes and monster mayhem. ",1
118373, An exercise in sober drama and a middle-class cautionary tale which explores a family ripped up by the roots after the rape of a 14-year-old girl.,1
108209, The listless execution may remind you less of 8 1/2 than of Woody Allen's whiny Stardust Memories.,0
120348," Stylish, suspenseful and spiked with sly wit.",1
6946," Ready Player One is a feast of nostalgia, action and visual style, which more than makes up for its fairly minor narrative shortfalls.",1
241028," Though the sketches featuring the two head-bopping losers have sometimes been hysterical on the show, the premise just doesn't translate to a feature film.",0
251134," It has the elegance associated with haute cuisine, so it rises a level above your typical Hollywood chick flick.",1

197083," If Ford's character is too much like the ones he played in Patriot Games and The Fugitive, at least Firewall restores his status of everyday action hero.",1
209904," The same lame puns wedged into a succession of situations, rather than a story.",0
162719," ""Man of Steel"" has a scope that's hard to resist, but what's missing is a sense of lightness, of pop joy.",1
229874, ...one of the more effective black comedies to come around in quite some time.,1
236012," With a glint in his eye and a 'caw!' on his lips, Michael Keaton takes the unexpected opportunity that is Birdman and soars with it.",1
217343," Despite its high-toned, artsy antecedent, Swicord's direction lacks fluency: that graceful, imaginative ease with visual expression that signifies real film artistry.",0
178853, The film's well-worn concept is re-energised with some ingenious plot swerves and a last-act shock right up there with Gone Girl.,1
150988, A laugh-free script that's underscored by a nasty mean streak...,0

73592, If the finale does flirt with tragedy...the aftertaste is refreshingly sardonic.,1
115483, A dreamlike reverie as well as a uniquely American origin story...,1
134298, Doillon's film opens with Auguste Rodin working on his sculptural interpretation of Dante's The Gates of Hell. It is all too tempting to see this as a metaphor for the film as a whole. ,0

45553, Casanova takes the story of history's greatest self-professed lover (not counting Wilt Chamberlain) and drains it of all sexuality or sensuality.,0
159490," That a remake of Carrie should turn out to be a pathetic retread of the same emotions, step-by-step, executed with far less skill and visceral punch is probably to be expected.",0
229623, America Ferrera projects such star power here that I felt cheated when the camera moved to other characters. The rest of the film seemed to drag for me.,0
22581," In taming these Beasts into screenplays, one wishes the novelist Rowling had maintained the services of a good editor.",0
4081," Instead of being trapped in one bedroom, this family has quite a few escape routes that they use quite a bit, which doesn't really help build a sense of dread. It just makes you think, ""Get out of the house, fools. The door's right there.""",0

104252," [A] brilliantly animated, cleverly written family adventure.",1
77143," The nostalgia doesn't quite convey, no matter how hard one claps for a computer-generated, Lunesta butterfly-like Tinker Bell. Old musicals tend to run long and come across as strangely convoluted.",0
184955," One of the raunchiest, dirtiest, most hilarious movies in recent memory and, hands down, the best American comedy of the year so far.",1
195563," There is an undoubted vision behind the cameras, one that is bound to only crystallize if the powers-that-be give this potential new franchise the nurturing it deserves.",1
106705," A road-trip comedy in equal measures bittersweet and hopeful, Mendes's latest boasts few of his stuffy aesthetic trademarks.",1

126719, Eastwood has crafted one of the most powerful American dramas in years.,1
181665, But Lucky You would be distinctly better if it were shorter in length and clearer about the rules of the game. Its idea that gamblers carry on much the same in life as they do at the tables is hardly original enough to sustain the whole film.,0
178967, The film's talented performers are wasted thanks to a weak script.,0
235491," To say the film is sitcom-y is to belabor the obvious. ""Ramona and Beezus"" is a welcome throwback to the nuclear-family-centered sitcoms of the 1950s and '60s and a low-tech charmer, and the cast elevates it all, especially King.",1
34770," Not Shaun, but still pretty good.",1
217097, So devoid of any spark that it feels like watching someone's boring vacation videos.,0

91681," The first half of Jai Simha sets the pace for the film well, making one curious to where this is all heading. But post-interval, the film takes not just a predictable path, but also a borderline nonsensical one.",0
249892," I'm having a hard time remembering what the really funny bits in Get Him to the Greek were, exactly. I mean, I know I laughed. I just don't really remember why.",1
242174," The film does have a modest, commercial watchability, but Steven Knight's screenplay never quite convinces, while Zemeckis seems to believe that with enough camels, vintage Citroën cars and urgent wartime sex, he'll have a big hit on his hands.",0
206775, It keeps striking home ferociously.,1
33092, This wasn't meant to be a pretty story. Pretty stories are the ones movie studios tell us about their most powerful actors to coax us into theaters...,1
31319," While its fish-out-of-water premise has promise, the uneven blend of action and low-key comedy isn't particularly satisfying.",0
115975, There isn't anything here that is nurtured enough to resonate either emotionally or mythologically once the film is over.,0
26680," The result is an eccentric, amusing fable that moves at an unhurried island pace, a picturesque tale that Merchant seems to have invested with an almost personal sense of spirit.",1
132148," In the end, Daybreakers doesn't really want to make anyone think too hard. If that were to happen, they might stop to wonder why all the human survivors out there hiding in fear of their lives don't just become garlic farmers and call it a day.",0
107651," For a movie shaped by the harsher mercies of martial pursuits, it's incredibly light and frequently hilarious.",1
107877, For two movies in a row now -- and possibly even more in the second than the first -- [Abrams has] caught some of the spark of the first Star Trek without either mimicking or desecrating the original.,1
44045," Distilling the finest and most absurd tenants of the Western genre and the most indulgent concessions to the Coens' idiosyncratic filmmaking yet, the film is not just the most essential film in the brothers' catalogue.",1
31064," If the 1984 film was the supernatural spectacular, the remake's the movie that spectacularly misunderstands the original's appeal. ",0
218354," Leave it to the French to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller, a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama.",1
40203," If you're hoping to forget your troubles for 90 minutes, Scary Movie certainly does the job.",1
182324," ""Loving"" is both a love story and the subject of that landmark SCOTUS decision in 1967. The couple endured great adversity, and it is depicted well, and, in the end, overcame that adversity in a big way.",1
84298," The posthumous campaign to polish Michael Jackson's tarnished reputation continues apace with this Spike Lee infomercial, commissioned by Sony and the money-grubbing Jackson estate to promote the 25th anniversary of his 1987 album ""Bad.''",0
23920," Despite the overdone stylistics in the film's final third, Sen-Gupta's dark dreamscape distills notions of vulnerability with gritty power.",1

84417, Barson's documentary is as much a celebration as it is a study of this long career in comedy,1
150919," Like it's titular component that's known for spraying bullets everywhere in the belief that enough will hit to do the job, the film might have benefitted more from a carefully aimed rifle approach instead. (Movie Review for Parents also available)",0

190577, I think it's safe to say releasing Zack Snyder's Cut of this film will give audiences the better product,0
17466," Triple 9 races past in a blur of crime and action scenes, with plenty of violence and the odd spot of gallows humour to keep things interesting.",1
17392," Fans at the screening I attended tittered throughout, perhaps finding the story's overwhelming cheesiness harder to take when seeing it enacted before their eyes.",0
226549, Mostly the film creates an infectious feeling of apprehension that slowly crawls up your spine.,1
176870," Much like the television pilot it revolves around, the pale satire The TV Set doesn't quite know what it wants to be.",0
127408," The script is honest, mature, and genuinely touching in many ways. The performances by the lead cast are sincere and filled with heart.",1
45180," This may be a 'chick flick' or, I suppose, a 'cow flick.' But I'd like to know what 'bull' can resist that.",1
75576," The preview audience watched most of this in stony silence, broken only by the contented sound of critics scratching bad dialogue in their notepads.",0

59776, 'Gotti' (alternate title: 'Gotti: I'm Walkin' Heah!') feels exactly like it was directed by a grown man who owns a framed 'Scarface' poster.,0
212985," A sequel that continues to entertain, but less convincing than the original. [Full review in Spanish]",1
131230," Although not without its entertaining moments, the result is so over the top that we'll never again be able to look at Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning's identical setup in Man on Fire without chortling.",0
35250," This pair's adventure, which is equal parts gunplay and magic, is a bit dull at heart, but the well-imagined setting livens things up.",1
150909," The real highlights are the performances from the small yet talented cast, mainly from protagonist Tim Roth, who carries the hardest scenes without faltering in his reactions, both physical and emotional. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
12382," It all feels like Hollywood pathos... It's the sign of a filmmaker that doesn't really have anything to say, so he just shows some tragedy and lets his actors cry about it.",0
199017, The slightest twinge of emotional conflict sends the lead character outside to stare blankly into the sunlight... those empty stares are almost too apt for a film with an offscreen story that is so much more interesting than the actual movie.,1
71731," Traffik is as entertaining as sitting in literal traffic-waiting for something to happen, only to be disappointed by the result.",0
36037," It plays with the idea that all rebellion is in some sense performed and makes a caricature out of the immature, attention-hungry mother, but it never liberates its characters from their molds.",0
211365," This a quasi-war movie set in peacetime; these men are fighting to the death, but not for nation or principle or ideology - or at least, not a conscious ideology: they are caught in larger economic currents.",1
12509," Donbass has the same faults as [director Sergei Loznitsa's] other fictions, but it is something more interesting. [Full review in Spanish]",1
73991, Mostly goes through the repetitive motions on the way to its predetermined outcome.,0

2907," You've been laughing at this movie for months, and the final product earns all of your worst preconceptions. ",0
87649," ""The Best of Me"" is content to remain a by-the-numbers excursion into tough-to-swallow soap opera theatrics. At this point, even Nicholas Sparks himself should know better.",0
65578," The solid ticking-clock biopic should perform respectably among serious-minded moviegoers, but lacks the oomph of a must-see.",1
143179," Impossible to overstate the influence of Ford's magnificent film, generally considered to be the first modern Western.",1
193591," While it isn't clear if another version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is necessary, Fincher couldn't make it boring with all this lurid material... But in any language with anyone at the helm, Lisbeth is still a killer.",1

87598, Solid leading man in a robust and heroic production that always feels a bit rushed and truncated,1
194439," It may not be hip or cool or young, or even particularly hilarious, but a night with the Portokaloses is like any family reunion: fun, awkward, funny, sometimes embarrassing, but full of love.",1
117453, It's Shannon and Spacey who conclusively put the concept over.,1

67335," Hawkins wears her grin in almost every scene, but she gives us hints that this dizzy 30-year-old is deep, as are the disappointments that might have caused Poppy to don this mask. It's a performance of sustained, childlike wonder and adult wit.",1

13426," Abramovic is raw and likeable, if mostly inscrutable.",1
250478, A movie whose glass is half empty - maybe it's just not possible to have a story about a 5-year-old's de facto stalker that isn't sure what it (or we) should think about the matter.,0

42487, A flawed but masterful film.,1
81847," Crown Heights is underwritten, but Colin Warner's story deserves to be heard and you could do much worse than this earnest and watchable retelling populated with confident performances.",1
13630," Much of the poop humor is surprisingly fresh and funny, as in the scene where only a shower curtain separates an enormous man bent on relieving himself and the hidden, breath-holding boy he's been chasing. You know, if you go for that sort of thing.",1
11417, A genre film that favours characterisation and morality over mayhem (but gets the mayhem right too).,1
133859," By way of remarkable sleight-of-hand, Steven Soderbergh's Magic Mike both is and is not the freewheeling, fun-loving, male stripper extravaganza its trailers peddle.",1

185019," Fantasia/2000 will no doubt become a Disney perennial, but that does not by definition make it a classic.",1
234086," Here, Bryson's a wizened cipher, wrapped in a grizzled grump, inside a pickled jerk. Patter gets pat, wise old-guy talk vies with lame wisecracks, and slapstick turns slapschtick. This slog's a waste of time and space.",0
193842," With no narration or context, its subject matter comes across as dry, while the enviro-message is undermined by a yawn-inducing lack of urgency.",0

65508, This initially promising blind-woman-in-peril thriller soon loses its way.,0

134416, An alternately fascinating and troubling film.,1

235658, This big screen adaptation of the '90s jiggle-fest edges very close to guilty pleasure territory. But it out-stays its welcome - and fails to deliver any big laughs.,0

22170, This is a perfectly serviceable stab at updating the Tarzan story.,1

70673," If you're going to make a movie about best friends, you need to give them more ways to relate to each other than opening their mouths wide and squealing. ",0
72835, If Payback and Ransom dated and had a child it would be called Edge of Darkness. Gibson and Winstone shine in this revenge film with a purpose.,1

48131," Wiseman has captured the experience of wandering through a living gallery of performance, adroitly defining not only why ballet is one of the most beautiful of human endeavours, but also why it is the most impenetrable of all our art forms.",1
53757, The humor tends toward the mildly crass -- bare buttocks and inappropriate scratching are Schwimmer's go-to comedy staples -- and the story is ridiculous.,0
120572," As the current reigning king of comedy, Hart shows no signs of abandoning his throne any time soon.",1
47179, A touching biopic with a timely universal message about brotherhood and tolerance.,1
12989," After the moderate success of Rocky, Sly is desperate to revive his other popular series, but this actioner, which exploits Burma's politics, is so retro and poorly executed that it's not even fun as mindless entertainment.",0
18094," Intelligent, involving and conspicuously adult, ""Starting Out in the Evening"" is almost shocking in its distinctiveness, its ability to create high drama from an unlikely source.",1
122596," A movie with amazing scope but little drama. The level of tension in the film is like a toothache - constant, gnawing but not particularly enjoyable.",0
13270," A serious film that is never solemn, bristling with energy while reminding us that there is no statute of limitations on one's conscience. ",1
182467," Every beat of the story is a watered-down, jokeless version of previous children's films ... The Nut Job seems designed to trick misinformed parents into plopping down money to occupy their children for just over an hour.",0
113440," It has a sufficient amount of genre pleasures, with gorgeously detailed locations and scary monsters, but the narrative is confused, at times impersonal, and does not justify its 127-minute running time.",0
33228," Of all the movies Jodie Foster could tackle, why would she choose a junky blood-and-whisky-soaked genre piece where everybody calls her ""Old Woman?""",0
203786," 'Ghost Protocol' is a stripped-down, lo-fi 'Mission Impossible' that winds the nail biting up to a near-unbearable cliffhanger degree, thanks to Brad Bird's sense of drama and timing.",1
21348," Formulaically uplifting. More hagiography than biography, it winds up an inspirational tale told in an uninspired way.",0
43970," Den of Thieves desperately wants to be Heat or The Killer when it grows up. Instead it's a daft, distant, drunken cousin to those pictures, but if you studiously avoid thinking about it, you can at least enjoy its moronic antics.",0
188794," The reverence is inert, the violence noxious, the mythology murky, the tone grandiose, the texture glutinous. It's an alternate version of The Incredibles minus the delight.",0
29675," Some movies are 'must-see,' but '12 Years a Slave' goes beyond that to 'deserves to be seen' status. The film, which tells a true story, is a rarity that pulls no punches about the hellishness of slavery. ",1

114973," Irritatingly cozy and with few unexpected turns, the film is just too cute for its own good.",0
98194, Scott weaves back and forth in time to flesh out the family history which informs the summer of '73 and one comes away aghast at the soul curdling effect of vast wealth and full of admiration for the wily strength of Gail Harris.,1
211114, This ridiculous but ridiculously entertaining film seems written by Mad Libs: Let's have Vin Diesel [action verb] in a [location completely unrelated to action verb].,1
199535," It's so easy to see that the screen has been limited to the conventions of a stage, with claustrophobic results. You keep wanting the camera to do more...As a consequence, Steve Jobs has no cinematic moments, no movie magic.",0
104212," Vivid, occasionally funny, but not as funny as it thinks; heartbreaking and gut-wrenching; too self-aware and hipster by half; and true enough when it matters to be disturbing and confronting.",1

4417, I want to believe in superheroes. It's just that Glass never quite manages to take flight.,0
134399," The film definitely has its moments, and at arm's length, The Promise will resonate. But overall, it feels like a missed opportunity, a good film that could have been much better.",1
25771," Tramps won't stay in your mind for days after, but it's a genuine delight.",1
242220, Miscast Lancaster fails to be a compelling figure - either tragic or malevolent - and the entire film collapses around him.,0
250870," Is that really Elizabeth Banks co-starring in this junk, or is it a look-alike pod with Paris Hilton's brain?",0
235971," Watching it, you're pulled in so completely that you begin to lose your bearings, too.",1
157870," What distinguishes Castillo's film is the facility and accuracy with which she understands, remembers and recreates the fish-bowl vistas and claustrophobic intimacy of a long car-bound journey.",1
152843," Proves a surprisingly unimaginative cops vs. drug lord story, complete with the weathered veteran forced to take a rookie under his wing.",0
6451, Leah Meyerhoff's earnest debut is more notable for the integrity of its female point of view and the consistency of its raw yet dreamy visual scheme -- which includes stop-motion fantasy interludes -- than for its familiar coming-of-age scenario. ,1
1688," Part human drama, part mystery, and part technical babble about viral mutations, and, with that wide breadth of concentration, each element falls short.",0
224855, A thrilling exploration of romantic disappointment with a killer soundtrack.,1

41595," Director Tom Holland's totally banal and pedestrian horror movie is the ""thinner"" end of the wedge as far as awful adaptations of King's books go. ",0
197272, A sexy thriller that is neither sexy nor thrilling.,0
32372," Trying to turn such acerbic raunch into a sweet redemptive comedy is like trying to negotiate an RV around a hairpin turn, and ""We're the Millers"" just can't make it. ",0

51263," If Cronenberg's not yet a dead ringer for his iconic dad, he's taken an intriguing first step.",0
144058, Don't run away with the idea that this is a film for your parents. There is no reason why people under 40 or pushing 30 shouldn't see it.,1
34438," You can't help wondering what it's trying to say, and whether it's even worth saying. Does the boxing-as-redemption cliché really need regurgitating? ",0
135173, White Reindeer is too downbeat and maudlin to become a true Xmas classic but offers an interesting alternative with a vaguely heart-warming message about muddling through the trials and tribulations of our flawed and fragile lives.,1
177720," What these movies require is against-all-odds chemistry, and Shepard and Bell have that in spades.",1
52765," Loses some of the innocence and wonder that buoyed along the first film, but replaces it with carefully thought out meditation on what it means to grow up.",1

79978, The movie is genuine in its inauthenticity.,0
182146, It's heartening to see a movie about teenage girls that is concerned with serious questions and avoids the pettiness that filmmakers tend to ascribe to young women of that age.,1
242888, The Jane Austen Book Club is pitched as The First Wives Club for coffeehouse intellectuals.,0
243839," ...an unmitigated disaster from start to finish, offering up a level of sheer dullness that's shocking...",0
166818," For all its formal austerity, All Is Lost also offers itself as a widescreen multiplex attraction, keeping all eyes glued on Our Man's dilemma, and every mind wondering if he'll manage to cheat death.",1

229595," Will prove difficult to swallow for most, what with its unblinking depiction of human-on-human consumption, but those with a stomach of steel will be treated to a shockingly delicious slice of cannibal-horror fare. ",1
73769," Too drab to succeed even as defiantly unvirtuous trash ... stifles Diesel's rough-hewn charisma via a sludgy, impermeable oil spill of CGI effects - in the service of largely unspectacular hocus pocus.",0
227005, ...one of the most nakedly passionate on-screen romances of the year thus far.,1
101414," Similar to Eddie Murphy's hard right turn from daring and profane comedy to family-friendly romps, Vaughn and Wilson have gone all soft and gooey here. ",0
243117, If Stanley Tucci wanted to capture the tedium involved in sitting for a portrait for a famous artist he succeeded. This is a movie as tedious to sit through as it was for James Lord to sit for the 1964 painting by Alberto Giacometti.,0
44061," Though the scenery is often breathtaking in its post-apocalyptic blight, Hallström's movie is as staid and impenetrable as the frozen loam on which he sets its foundation.",0
61823, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is what the fans were waiting for. Ideal for the ones that aren't passionate about the saga because they will find reasons to fall in love with this universe. [Full review in Spanish],1

239786," Without Molina and Lithgow, the film might feel like little more than a light experiment in social dynamics. But nearly everything about ""Love Is Strange"" suits it ...",1
215831, Villeneuve has failed to deliver anything near the emotional intensity of his previous work and the ever-dependable Adams can't save the film from some ponderous sci-fi noodling.,0
34158," The play has been superbly opened out, and the prowling cinematography of Thimios Bakatakis (Attenberg, The Lobster) and Fiona Crombie's cheerless sets combine to sustain an oppressive mood throughout.",1

72722," Pretty close to being a perfect outing at the movies. And considering the marvels Pixar has already given us year after year, that's a stunning achievement.",1
182336," Comes off more like a theme park show than an actual film, it's there to deliver stunts and never an actual story. ",0
213820, The only real imagination in the whole film comes late--in the rather terrifically designed end titles.,0
9477," [An] all-style, little-substance barrage of hand-to-hand combat and gun battles that play like a first-person-shooter video game.",0

56805, A good idea that languishes... [Full review in Spanish],0
39527," It won't make many new converts, but Adam Sandler fans will be plenty happy with Jack And Jill, a broad and endearingly loopy family comedy in which Sandler stars alongside himself (in drag) and, even more bizarrely, Al Pacino playing himself.",1
52209," It packs a little of everything into an entertaining package: love story, mystery, action and discussion about free will and fate.",1
132302," Two roommates start to antagonize each other after one becomes the other's superior at an LA car wash, and the conflict is played out with grittiness and flippancy.",0
64063," For all its flaws, the film's underlying sweetness makes it hard to dislike. Good, too, to see punk icon Joe Strummer - played with bolshie vim by Jonathan Rhys Meyers - as the story's unexpected fairy godfather.",1
6684, Pearl Harbor's love story is tailor made for daytime soap operas.,0
33735," Kidron's direction stays flat even when the actors are funny. It doesn't help that the screenplay, by Douglas Carter Beane, is so thin that one of its biggest events is the three main characters' having car trouble.",0
161059, Sprawling crime drama about a high-achieving young Parisian lawyer forced to dump a seemingly picture-perfect life and go on the run is a suspenseful journey with emotional detours.,1

8345," [Bryan] Cranston plays Trumbo with an edgy, raging wit.",1
8284," ""A Late Quartet"" has the start of an interesting idea. However, this film has two major factors that prevent it from achieving [its] goal: an overdose of melodrama and storylines that don't mesh, or even feel like they should be in the same movie.",0

220160, Decent cop-crime-thriller gets ambitious and loses all the goodwill it built up with its brainless action sequences.,0
61464," A true tear jerker, but A Monster Calls is worth enduring such a heartbreaking story.",1
89046, The soul of one of rock's true poets is examined in an appropriately abstract way in Steven Sebring's black and white documentary that could have benefited from more of Patti Smith's songs and another pass in the editing room.,1

49442," Boy Erased is still a respectable effort, serious and sober, about a very real, very bad practice. The film's heart is firmly in the right place. ",1
63515," Been there, undead that.",0
31114, It would take a critic more churlish than this one to sneer and bare chickenlike talons at Roll Bounce,1

54535, The forgettable Max Steels offers a meandering and lifeless superhero origin story.,0
179180," The movie itself seems equally divided between the sensibilities of hyperverbal writer Diablo Cody and music-centric director Jonathan Demme, and ends up falling into a muddy gap between the two.",0
239101," It's a handsomely designed film, tasteful, reserved, rather dull.",0
75072," Not only that Argo is both intelligent and entertaining, it's riveting from start to finish.",1
55758," Simien shoots satirical buckshot, missing as often as he hits, and the clunky framing device is pure amateur hour, yet he also displays an attention to character complexity that shows genuine promise.",0
198200," By trying too hard to stay on this side of hip and the other side of sentimental, Crowe winds up with a zoo that's neither fish nor fowl.",0
70032," The film is strange and beautiful to look at, but it also treads the melodramatic edge of a horrific surrealism.",1

75823," It appears impossibly mannered, a cross between knock-off Dennis Potter and an episode of Bread.",0
245006," Devine's slackadaisical approach infects the rest of ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,"" which starts out amusingly enough before caving in to a forced march of ""Oh no they didn't"" gags.",0
168758," With its fractured, elliptical narrative, Kissing Candice uses its form to perfectly illustrate its content. ",1
146546," Exposes the weakest parts of what many fans acknowledge is the most problematic of the four books, with too much focus on some of the story's most outlandish absurdities. ",1

153083," The feature debut from award-winning short film director Elisabeth Subrin is a rewarding, if occasionally solipsistic, study of a complex, mature woman at a crossroads in her life.",1
78741," It rivals the impact...Lost Highway [had for me], and is easily one of the best films I have ever seen.",1
117792," Bay doesn't have the operatic panache of Quentin Tarantino. At well over two hours, ""Pain and Gain"" should have gone for lean and mean. ",0
170540," It has no new information to offer regarding the case, and doesn't even do a terribly coherent job of organizing the details for the benefit of some hypothetical ignorant viewer.",0
30130," One minute, the film is funny. The next it's romantic. For a few seconds, it's suspenseful. Other times, it's philosophical. But mostly, it's just confusing.",0

15949," A lovely story that's sweet, funny and heartfelt -- and man does it sound good.",1
220376," This is a film that wants to be more than a mindless action flick and it tries, desperately, but just can't deliver. A pity, although it does prove your first instinct was right: a British thriller starring Jason Statham is all you need to know.",0

164415," Traditional drama is usually a three-act deal: set-up, conflict, resolution. But this is the three-act deal every two minutes. Danger, baddie, magic. Danger, baddie, magic. Danger, baddie, magic. It's as tired as it is tiresome.",0
158679," Falls quite short of its mark, mostly due to the poor casting as well as a deathly slow pace that far too often veers away from [the film's] greatest strength, which is the music.",0

194121, A pedestrian-looking mishmash of a movie!,0

80088," It's not a great film, but in its reckless audacity ... it's reassuring. Someone's still willing to take a big chance.",1

135385," Strange and weird, yes. Scary, no.",0
162098," Poor acting, poor action, embarrassing writing, and lazy plotting sink this film almost before it gets started, but by the time the credits roll, you'll just be glad it's over.",0
251381," On all counts, the co-directors of this persuasive documentary set the right tone.",1
198057," It's rare for a film of average substance to feature the diverse gifts of a legendary actor, but director Roberts is smart enough to linger on Walken's intense, gaunt face.",0
245335," It gets a little silly, at times, particularly in the special-effects department, but Stewart and Pattinson are a quite mesmerising pair, and their twitchy, sidelong glances play out a duet of unspoken yearning that might just get under your skin.",1
12361, Dave Made A Maze will surely make you nostalgic for all the fun adventure movies of the 1980s.,1
53275," [It] works just as well for the uninitiated, as many of the directing duo's stylish editing patterns play with perceptions not just of giallo, but cinema as a whole.",1

12979," Elf will warm the heart with nostalgia, dazzle the eyes, tickle the funny bone, and make Christmas feel like it can't come fast enough.",1
249397," A movie that stands out not just because of the high production values, but also because of the great acting and a touching story. [Full review in Spanish]",1
67993," The fear is that Jones's storytelling smarts and aesthetic resourcefulness could wind up sacrificed to the chaos and overblown approach of a generic would-be blockbuster. Unfortunately, fear wins out.",0

81426," Violent actioner is dull, dreary, and defective.",0

28652," Granted, you don't go into this sort of thing expecting originality - or even coherence - but geez, a bit more effort would have been nice. Instead, we get a Z-grade knock-off of a B-grade cult film with half the style and none of the flair.",0

221213," A film that turn us into silent witnesses of the intimacy and secrets of ordinary human beings without judging them, leaving that to the viewer. [Full review in Spanish]",1
36960," Continuing to be the most original and resonant of the Marvel superhero franchises, the X-men return in the capable hands of director Bryan Singer, who again stirs plenty of meaty subtext beneath the thrilling action.",1
87949," Quite why Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine, the directors of the brilliant Crank, got involved is anyone's guess. Perhaps their tax bills were also due.",0
119971," It's entertaining, brainy and eye opening.",1
235003," Admittedly, the film is bolted to an intriguing psychological/paranormal premise, but the narrative trudges along in a fitful monotony of somber tones and stodgy pacing.",0
251117," At its heart, 'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island' aims for fun, old-fashioned thrills and delivers for the most part. It's a fun ride.(Parental Review also available)",1

59196," The action beats are the same as the earlier Mummys -- with planes, guns, digital creatures and vast armies of the risen-dead having at it. The missing ingredient here seems to be the fun.",0
100097, ... an illuminating and challenging experience for audiences.,1
164722," Considering the sordid themes running throughout Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, McDonagh's tone is astonishingly warm. He knows how to poke fun at characters' quirks without demeaning them.",1

7104, [An] old-fashioned and entertaining action-comedy.,1
162463," Part of the problem with Elysium is that writer-director Neill Blomkamp takes everything to such dramatic extremes that there is no time to consider or include moral ambiguity, or the real reason such a flawed and biased system continues to exist. ",0
111171," Anderson has created another unmistakably unique work, an intriguing look at grassroots religion through the relationship between two men who couldn't seem more different. ",1
236650," This movie doesn't have the wry kick of the TV show at its best. Too rich, too loaded, Maverick may have misplayed its cards, kept its eyes on the pot instead of the players. In movies, as in poker, you can't always trust a pat hand.",0
147418, The film about of a teenage Chinese-American boy struggling with adolescent issues while working in his family's fleabag motel has the precise brevity of a well-crafted short story.,1
84960," The worst thing about ""Life Itself"" is not that it is emotionally sadistic. It's just how much it wants to be emotionally sadistic, while simultaneously missing the mark by a mile. ",0
51130," It's all a little too cute and pat to be believable, and Tucker can't resist showing us everything he has learned about transsexuals in between the embarrassing moments and odd encounters.",0
242852," A marked disappointment after Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, this fourth installment in the franchise is a 157-minute holding pattern.",0
21903," The film is a technical tour de force, featuring a wealth of inventive design ideas. But James never develops the emotional dimension that Nightmare possessed.",1
63218," Happily this is not a sit-com, Adam Sandler does only one pratfall: a decent family drama with a gorgeous Paz Vega.",1
116974," Lowery's understated authority lifts his tragic romance above mere Malick mimicry, while Affleck and Mara bring heart to the scrupulous artistry.",1
152042, a brave attempt to wrestle with the impossible,1
171363, A gritty but rather pretentious tale of father-son conflict in a backwoods British family. ,0

100514," It's a wicked, violent parable, and one of the only movies of the summer worth talking about after the credits roll.",1
240798," [Hellboy] is gloomily gorgeous, but its tone careens recklessly between light comedy and dark portentousness and the character relationships suffer.",0
250948," For a series that was on the verge of being dismantled and sold for scraps, much like Bumblebee, it has found a saviour. Travis Knight has lived up to his name. The Transformers can wear his shiny armour.",1
10641, I Am Heath Ledger offers intimacy but little sense of discovery.,1
59988," While this tale of magical realism has potential for delightful originality, the love story lacks heat, the science fiction premise spirals into senselessness, and the third-act twist is alarmingly apparent within the first 10 minutes of the movie.",0
215644," A brilliantly twisted idea, horribly executed",0
159900," In the end, the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters - damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide.",1
143072, The Disaster Artist is an endearing tale of friendship and chasing your dreams that packs a surprisingly poignant punch.,1
154576," It's silly, sure. Trouble is, it's not silly enough...The action sequences are a let down; mostly shot in swish pans, the loss of brightness that comes with 3D makes much of the movie look like a murky blur. ",0
54522," Engaging but overlong, and more than a mite unsettling.",0
209215," As with Billy Elliot, where you didn't have to care about ballet to enjoy Billy's story, this is a joy whether you like wrestling or have never seen it before.",1
206294," Not bad adventure, nothing special, but not bad",1
108568," As a light, lovely-looking entertainment, Ladies in Black is a superlative chick flick that celebrates femininity and independence as mutually supportive qualities...the film also champions how Australia was built by a rich mix of cultures. ",1
39444, Meg Ryan sheds more than her clothes in this would-be steamy thriller. She sheds her twinkle.,0
51688," Far from a wide-eyed tale about the triumph of populist democracy, An Insignificant Man showcases that even in the muck of politics, incremental changes can truly be momentous.",1
108711," Insidious 2 really wants you to be happy, but it's far too much of an uneven mess to do it very well. ",0
204867," The movie really captures the often lonely, torturous existence of the true artist-a huge feat in itself.",1

119816, Quietly moving to watch [Dayveon] find something he can old on to between all the stupid that surrounds us.,1
132756," The broad shape of the ending is predictable; by the time you get to it, you could probably write the final confrontation yourself. This a likable, well-intentioned movie, but those qualities don't take it far enough.",0
193769," It has a pleasing, noodly elasticity about it -- the picture knows what its limits are and proceeds to boogie unself-consciously far outside them.",1
136716, An iconic film noir that's still fresh despite being familiar.,1
236329, Few things are more frustrating than seeing people who can't exercise free will because they exist in a nihilistic film fascinated with violence.,0
88141," It's a bit of a slow starter, but once it gets going, Kill List achieves a steady, nail-gnawing intensity and unpredictability. ",1

226276, Five Fingers for Marseilles is an achievement in cinema ... an emotionally relentless film which feels like it's been handled by masters of the craft.,1
102223," A modern classic; Brooks dialogue rings true; great performances by Hurt, Hunter and especially Albert Brooks make this a movie one can watch over and over again.",1
26752," In spite of the good work of its cast, the film is shipwrecked in its badly repressed desire to transcend the letter of the crime. [Full review in Spanish]",0

238151," You can do all things right, and fail. Mother!'s irritations are an itch its virtues can't scratch.",0
135138," Britt Poulton and Dan Madison Savage's movie never fully empathizes with its characters, so it comes off as crass voyeurism. ",0
185056," The release of ""Timbuktu"" could not be more timely, although the sad truth is that, nowadays, almost any time would do.",1

44641," It provides a vivid and moving portrait of a cruelly divided society of exploited, uprooted black people and troubled, guilty white people and has strong biblical undertones.",1
45179," His film does not mark [Banksy] out as the new Spielberg. Yet it is funny, OK in technique and now and then spicily critical of the art world.",1
116119," It's made by a guy who named himself after a mindless, soulless, wandering drone who can't make heads or tails of sense or sensibilities. I, for one, am not surprised the movie turned out the way it did.",0
249486," More is not better, even if it costs a reported $250 million. A good adventure story is better. A strong, well-examined villain is better. Lean and a little meaner is better.",0

89406, A resplendent feast for the eyes. Just don't expect anything resembling a coherent storyline.,1
15881," Miyazaki isn't taking sides, merely observing how the winds of fate often propel us into situations not entirely of our choosing and open to interpretation.",1
164008, Disney's The Princess and the Frog is an instant classic and one of the year's best films.,1
206184," Allure is an intriguing, stylishly visualised neo noir, but in the end, has neither the depth as a psychological drama, nor the suspense of a thriller, too often feeling dark and nasty for its own sake.",0

147724," He made me nervous because I never knew what he was going to do next, and that's what you want in a killer.",1
219774," ""I Am Evidence"" is a searing, lucid film that never shies from tough details, especially when survivors share their attacks in a powerful bearing of witness.",1
34790, It's a humorless PG-13 comedy aimed at middle school kids/some high school kids. Anyone else should stay at home and watch Over the Edge instead.,0
247181," The storyline may not thrill you, but Ian McKellen's performance will.",1
120732," Creative, careful, artful opening feels spun with magic. If only the rest was as rich as that opening sequence. That said, young folks even as young as 6 and 7 will love this picture -- all the way up to as old as 14.",1

150479," The film tries very hard, and sometimes the effort pays off, but overall this is a compromised effort that recalls LICENCE TO KILL in the wrong way: it wants to be different but lapses back into the same old, obligatory set pieces.",0
180276," Combining lush color with minute detail, Arrietty transforms the mundane into magic.",1
197565," The drama's uncompromising nature and, above all, Charlize Theron's powerful, physically astonishing performance should attract the kind of critical attention necessary to mine the specialized niche.",1

215714," Not instructive, as Disney is, and not aloof, like anime. Spirited Away is fun without being a lesson, and it welcomes you in.",1
19768," There are meaningful observations about the ways that money warps relationships and how children struggle with their heritage. But by trying so hard to concoct a blowout party, the film exhausts and frustrates as much as it enlightens and delights.",0

67623, Quirky and weird with little to offer beyond that despite Michael Shannon and Veronica Ferres' impressive performances.,0

90229," The film gets better as it goes, and the last half-hour (especially in 3-D on an Imax screen) is nearly everything it should be: scary, visually momentous, meticulously realized.",1
25093," The stylistic palette of McQueen's picture, and its grasp of cinematic vocabulary, elevate the film to a purely visceral realm, so that it seems to bypass your eyes and ears and go straight for your nerve endings.",1
31902," The movie's overlong, underpopulated and often devastating to watch. But it's told with an uncanny realism, and when it's over you feel shaken and a little sick - and realize that you can finally exhale.",1
171348," It fits with [Anderson's] previous acclaimed efforts ""Boogie Nights"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" as an epic account of a shady subculture, rich in period detail and memorable performances.",1

6868, The Infiltrator is worth seeing for Cranston alone.,1
96997," On the awesome-spectacle front, director Michael Bay raises the action bar to a completely new jaw-dropping level with this second sequel.",1
228414," Bay has simply botched the job. His action sequences, especially those on the asteroid, are impenetrable and chaotic. And the narrative, larded with the usual military double-cross, is preposterous.",0

19152," Not that these things don't matter, but they don't exactly make for riveting cinema.",0
205277," Director Raoul Peck picks up where the author left off, using the unfinished manuscript as a kind of blueprint for this incendiary, Oscar-nominated documentary.",1

43176," Strong on premise, the film is short on plot.",1
27718," Bale is good--solid amid the ongoing storm--but don't expect much of him. This is Sam Worthington's movie, and he steals it.",1

216039, What fun! Not really.,0
170868," The visual allure of this production is undeniable, but having the nerve to be simple and nice all the way through is, even for Disney, verging on being a lost art.",0
32333," People cynically walk into so much expecting disappointment - auditoriums showing Woody Allen's annual crapshoot, for example. Sometimes, they get expected middling results. Sometimes, as with Allen's 30-year-old script, they get unanticipated surprises.",1
5071, The [filmmakers were] hard-pressed to come up with enough story for even an old-time six-minute cartoon short.,0
184306," With its fast editing and handheld camerawork, the film zips along lightly. Like a classic O Henry short story, it has a sting in the tail. But it's above all about conjuring a sense of atmosphere and place.",1

64130," Ben Wheatley shouldn't settle for becoming the next Guy Ritchie. For some reason, he'd like to.",0
173159," It's only got one basic gag, hatefully lazy and stupidly repetitive. Ferrell's man-child just keeps gagging on the stereotype of prison rape. When the end of Get Hard finally arrives, it's 95 minutes too late.",0

104209, This year's Bond Villain means to make a mint off water.,0
150373," It wants to be a responsible topical thriller, but the change in focus from the fed-up prole to the battle-hardened broadcast virtuosos is so misjudged that the movie comes off as socially unconscious.",0
91389, Brawl in Cell Block 99's economy of storytelling is as efficiently brutal as the eventual skull-crackings. ,1

208198," In a year full of disturbing events, there's something uniquely unsettling about seeing Michael Shannon look as shaken as the rest of us. Maynard might save Christmas, but we all lose a little something along the way.",0
77887, Shock And Awe hasits share of some minor storytelling flaws - but executes a relevant reflection on the state of journalism.,1
188617," Cronenberg's film takes place in a kind of pharmaceutically heightened hyper-reality of its own: it's not so much a twisted dream of making it in show-business, as a writhing, hissing, Hollywood waking nightmare.",1

65872," There's plenty of action and typical Bond elements to be found throughout, but the execution felt a bit generic to me. It also doesn't help that Denise Richards drags the movie down every time she appears on-screen.",0

216709," While THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO treats the men's tales with respect, astute viewers will question the nature of the youths' visits.",1
129202, How well does the film succeed in what it seeks to accomplish? Well enough that I probably won't mind a 'Transporter 3.' ,1
23420, It's pretty bad. You don't need me to tell you that.,0
186038," This is a brow-beating, 123-minute-long boxing opus that brings absolutely nothing new to the ring. ",0

79700, There are so many stories to tell about unfortunate people who get arrested and imprisoned for selling drugs. So why-oh-why did anyone think this real-life tale about a white 15-year-old drug dealer in 1980s Detroit was the one worth revealing? ,0

145149," Rarely do things get as inspired as in the 'Wallace & Gromit's. The vibe is one of modesty and relaxation, as though it will settle for a smile permanently plastered on your face rather than sporadic guffaws.",1
56593," Depicting both French and Moroccan culture with sympathy and wit, Raja uses the language barrier between the would-be lovers as an excuse to throw up a network of perpendicular commentary.",1
166392," There's an undeniable formal elegance in the way Ferrara, who coauthored the script with Zoe Lund, frames and holds certain shots, and Keitel certainly gives his all.",1
64465," Emelie isn't doing anything we haven't seen before, but it proves that a solid screenplay and director, as well as dead-on casting can produce a gem of a movie that is more than worthy of a viewing on your Friday or Saturday night.",1

117474," Although it uses a debate-friendly topic as its narrative fulcrum, it's really just a simple romance that delivers the same ol' message about love loosening people up.",0
36369," Yann Demange's film most backgrounds the politics in favor of nervy suspense, you-are-there verisimilitude and strong characterizations.",1
223778," An old-fashioned, unpretentious epic that reliably gets where it needs to go.",1
249927," Quicksilver ... is the coolest of this picture's new guys, zipping around so fast ... that he can taste soup, rearrange guards' limbs, and nudge bullets off their trajectories all in the time it takes to blink.",1

106793," It is a canny piece of pop art, and The Lego Movie should end up delighting old and young viewers in equal measure.",1
57925," [Oz] qualifies as a cautionary tale, not about the perils of ambition and selfishness, but about the movie industry's misguided belief that it can distract the audience from a film's narrative weaknesses with little more than flash and spectacle.",0

198038," ""Elaine Stritch"" is filled with bluster and memories, blunt outbursts and funny moments. But more importantly, it is filled with honesty.",1
125389," Though far from a perfect film, The Hunting Ground is a significant piece of advocacy journalism that shows young women refusing to be mute about crimes that have been commited against them.",1
172633," Our enjoyment is supposed to lie in making fun of the obvious red herrings, contrived opportunities to show cleavage, melodramatic dialogue, gullible characters, and inevitable to-be-continued ending.",0

23114," As Sydney White again demonstrates, [Amanda Bynes] just doesn't seem to have found a script that lives up to her comic potential.",0
207902," The movie is too long, too violent, too silly-too everything. Yet for those who enjoyed the original Kingsman, it is a more than adequate second act. To put it another way: First time satire, second time farce.",1

229474, A challenging take on human sexuality and the shared language of sometimes erroneous assumptions that enables us to navigate relationships.,1

38704, Paprika stays in your mind as pure freedom and pure exhilaration.,1
249795," It's good that [documentarian Alex] Gibney doesn't turn [Lance] Armstrong into a martyr, but that's mostly because he doesn't have anything to say.",0
129186, William Eubank continues to work his particular mind-stretching mix of acute character interplay and cosmic conceptual breakthrough.,1
144383," An intelligent, well-made and seductive movie.",1
34," Ghost is a movie about corporate malfeasance and greed, aided by bloody awful early CGI and predicting the basic flippancy of Forrest Gump and American Beauty. ",0

146359, Runaway train thriller is more suspenseful than violent.,1

74928, Doesn't punch nearly as hard without Coogler in its corner.,0
135029," Thoughtful action picture? Meditation on grieving? The Brave One tries to be both but just misses its target, despite the presence of a magnetic Jodie Foster.",0
72694," ""Extraordinary Tales"" reminds viewers that animation can enable an artist to realize an individual vision, even on a limited budget.",1
204619," The film has style, has panache, and a strong vision ... It uses Detroit beautifully, evoking chilling foreboding from rows of deserted houses shot from the car's POV in an autumnal dread.",1

220190," Rather than leaving the writing of her story up to others, [Agnès] Varda makes a bold statement by taking authorial control herself, focusing on what she wants to be remembered for.",1
134452, Starts out as a funny high scorer but limps into a second half as flat as those quarters we once pumped into arcade machines long ago.,0
147184," The trick to a comedy like this is to make an audience care about these goofballs, but we're just like everyone else the brothers come into contact with. We simply wish they would go away.",0

161273," While that sounds like a fantasy for rock aficionados, the scenes lack dramatic tension or cinematic enlightenment. It just kind of happens, and then the all-star jam fades to black, leaving few remnants of the filmmakers' initial intentions.",0
169616," There's no way you will fall in love with Baggage Claim, but there's a good chance you'll like it.",1
119385," One of those sequels that not only is bad on its own, but makes you think twice about enjoying the original.",0
217846," Bill Condon's live-action update of Beauty and the Beast is more reimagining than remake, a lavish and lovely take on a familiar tale (as old as time, no doubt) that enriches its source material without betraying it.",1
220293," A frail conceit that Allen fills out with humor that's surprisingly obvious and broad...a mildly diverting fantasy, executed without much style.",0
195180," It feels like a throwback of sorts, a new movie reminiscent of John Carpenter's twisted work from the 1980s, including the diabolical electro-synth score.",1

58523," The movie is not, as the trailer suggests, a tale of the triumph of the human spirit. It's about luck. It's about sadness. But it's also about the way that victims of the disaster -- of any disaster -- band together.",1
100742," Dialogue is minimal and events, such as they are, are propelled by a whimsicality characteristic of its era.",1
168989," As a raunchy romantic comedy or an homage to the 1980s, Take Me Home Tonight is hardly worth a one-night stand.",0

35660, [Alfonso Cuaron] proves again what a versatile and talented director he is.,1
192918," It's campier than its predecessor, but its gung ho union of black, white, and Asian gangs against reactionaries who'd destroy them is a virtuosic assertion of punky Parisian multiculturalism.",1

75107," ""Finding Dory"" strikes just the right notes when it comes to creating a film with heart and a positive message.",1
228729," Granted, ""The Grandmaster"" is not a primer on Chinese philosophy. Yet it may score as crossover cinema for Wong fans and Lee fans.",1
73186," A curiosity that is neither funny nor striking enough. The most striking thing about it is the ballooning gut of Gerard Depardieu, whose barge-like girth is truly astonishing.",0

162312, ...an aggressively uneven piece of work that would hardly be worth mentioning were it not for the efforts of Bridges and his stellar cast mates...,1
144737, [Rosenmeyer and Conner are] quick to endear themselves to us so we can look past any hiccups and let their sitcom antics sustain a brisk sub-80-minute runtime.,1

204803," By giving away the story's big reveal at the very beginning, it infuses the film with a potent sense of dread rather than suspense.",0
93129," Enough of the pic works, even considering its various issues, to earn a recommendation. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Suggestive Material, etc. - also Available)",1
45220," The songs still sound great here, but the instruments aren't amplified nearly as much as the nostalgia and vanity of the men who wield them.",0
24001, The world of Amelie has no politics. It has no issues. It only has an exaggerated sense of quirkiness and a pea-green tint that suggests an overblown sense of nostalgia for childhood.,0

12007," Arguably the most intelligent, hilarious sendup of the horror genre seen in decades.",1
66158," Solo isn't terrible, it isn't great; it's fine. A serviceable, if unmemorable space western that is pretty much redundant.",0

154908, The film really does the graphic novel justice.,1

237429," The new Ron Howard movie, ""Chaos & Disorder""--sorry, ""Angels & Demons""--is a sequel to 2006's ""The Da Vinci Code,"" and like that latter film, the news surrounding it is as dull as the luster on Miss California's crown.",0
31752, The most engaging parts are Bosch's reflections on the state of photography. [Full Review in Spanish],1
30773," Epitomised by Max Richter's beautiful but humourless score, The Congress is a mess of fascinating ideas that are drawn and quartered by the emotions attached to them.",0

109172, Seems pretty @#?!ing racist,0
208, A deeply frustrating head-scratcher.,0
159400, Force Majeure is both an insightful probe into gender roles and family dynamics and a clever lampoon of fragile bourgeoisie masculinity. ,1
80867, The songs are an insanely comic combination of infectious beats and deranged lyrics. The Judd Apatow-produced film pushes the raunch envelope farther than any mainstream comedy in memory.,1
231048," Buster Keaton's final independent film is one of his finest achievements, something of a greatest hits package in its refinement of old routines.",1
121779," Wonderfully vulgar, brilliantly performed, and accented with action reminiscent of an '80s buddy film, Pineapple Express is one late summer success.",1

164942," The film is a marvel, and everybody with any affection for animation is duty-bound to see it.",1
165858," A sprawling, messy work of inspired brilliance and real humanity, a film that enthralls and affects even as it infuriates and confounds.",1
161418," The film's highs are its light special effects and whimsical choreography. The ensemble cast is phenomenal, but Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling? Not so much. ",0
50504, Unsatisfying for all ages.,0
197231," ...Truly a wonder, a pile of self-contradictions, a series of wrongs that somehow make a right.",1
189422," This is the inaugural film in a franchise of 12 feature films based on Bible stories, using a crude form of three-dimensional computer animation. One can only hope that the future entries in the series are better executed than this first one.",0

219502," Ralph Fiennes is a tidal wave of energy, sweeping up all before him in this thriller.",1
220041," Bullhead becomes dark, minatory and coruscating in ways not light-aeons distant from Büchner or Scorsese.",1
91351, Outrageously funny situations and two sterling performances make this smartly written film about an unconventional family a sure-fire winner. ,1
184333," Light as flan, Km.O is a hopeful kindred spirit to other insouciant Spanish comedies.",1
184371," La La Land serves to remind us that movies can still be magical, and they can still provide the channel for us to see magic in the world around us.",1
170251," The thematic masochism is intrinsic to del Toro's art - miserably picking the scab of one's self-esteem. But the architecture here is too cardboard, despite a high level of craft among the cast, to make us feel the pain, too.",0
46024," This is so laughable it must be intended as camp. I was disappointed this wasn't a serious examination of the real Black Dahlia case. Oh, well, sometimes you don't get what you pay for and it's a pleasant surprise.",1
201246," When given the chance (which is always), the cast unlocks moments that are so intimate and naturally detailed, you would swear that the actors had no idea the cameras were rolling. ",1
37240," Matthew McConaughey has wisely opted out of the sequel - his character, stripper-impresario Dallas, has either passed on or moved overseas, it's not entirely clear - and with him goes much of the first film's gonzo spark.",0
157076," It's a film of unforgettable images, but one that finds purpose within them, a film that understands the value of sensation and texture and place no matter where it wanders.",1
114628," If the evil genius from the Saw films were real, these guys could survive his self-mutilation traps with little difficulty.",1
219372, A sweet and endearing take on the Snow White story buoyed by solid performances with one exception: Julia Roberts.,1
46878," ""Pawn Sacrifice"" whips up a dervish of energy and is mostly engaging, yet the movie isn't a definitive checkmate. The narrative ferocity is unable, try as it might, to smooth over some of the bumps in the story and gaps in the plotting.",1
38322," Anyone who thinks history is dry stuff should see ""Last Days in Vietnam"" - and heed its lessons.",1
221132, The trouble is that it's hard to care!,0
4738," All in all, Sparkle is a thoroughly entertaining movie. Viewers will get some laughs, maybe shed a few tears and definitely leave with their fill of good music.",1
71508, A particularly flavorless serving of flaccid beef jerky and brine-cured ham.,0
7554, One of Buster Keaton's most hilarious and most popular comedies,1
62807," Joseph L Mankiewicz's film dissects the narcissism and hypocrisy of the spotlight as sharply as [Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd], but pays equal attention to the challenges of enacting womanhood.",1
101775," I'm in the minority but Bond 24 looks like Bond 23, Bond 22, Bond ... etc. And it wastes Christoph Waltz who could have given us a villain as good as Gert Frobe's Goldfinger. ",0
126898, The original cast go out with a bang.,1
238919," Attempts to be a relatable chick flick for the gold card crowd, but the characters are so one-dimensional and cliché.",0
146782, The last installment in the Millennium series of Swedish films reveals the dangers of zealots in high places of power and prestige. ,1
59644, Castles In The Sky may well be modest in scale (and likely to have a greater life on television rather than the big-screen) but it's an entertaining look at a delightfully eccentric and brilliant scientist.,1
245173, This has more in common with a Wong Kar-wai film than any Hollywood movie I've seen lately.,1
63681, The set-up offers the nastiest parody of modern conformity since 'Idiocracy. But it doesn't follow through. It doesn't have the attention span.,1
28385, A second-rate jungle adventure that delivers far less than it promises.,0
21136, The film is ridden with clichés ... as many of these teenage market films are.,0
13167," Day Watch may not suit everyone, but it opens a big can of Russian whoop-de-whoop on anyone willing to take it.",1
89444," Unfortunately the film, directed by Leon Marr needs more pep in its step, could use some judicious trimming and... features an unmemorable, under-drawn group of resident seniors, a missed opportunity to help flesh out... this slender, tender tale.",0
121982," ... if you can shake out some of the chafing bits of sand that weigh down Loggerheads, you'll find a heartfelt story about people coming to terms with irrevocable loss.",1
224797," Oozing ambiguity, Jack Clayton's shimmering gem is a masterclass in suggestion, a flawless evocation of the uncanny which pits the subconscious against the supernatural to genuinely hair-raising effect.",1
89870," Unusually perceptive when it comes to matters of class and money, Lady Bird finds its dramatic heart in their testy, affectionate relationship, the most indelibly drawn mother and daughter since Terms of Endearment.",1
206751," Let Me In is not as fantastic as Let the Right One In, which you should rent immediately. But it is undeniably powerful and made with obvious admiration and respect for the source material.",1
125666, One of DiCaprio's best performances in an unforgettable psychological jigsaw puzzle.,1
147753," Game, set and dry match",1
124022," It would have, however, been nice if Generations would have gone beyond the scope of the television series to deliver something a bit more substantial.",0
115755," The story vacillates between broad, kid-friendly gags and a series of oddly sour riffs on the theme of adult sibling rivalry.",0
66568, The film that proves that all life's problems can be solved with a montage.,0
86445," A witty, highly entertaining blend of a multitude of genres, one that could truly be great if a bit more compressed.",1
51303," Challenging, dreamlike, and unrelentingly bleak, Hold the Dark is a western - and a Saulnier film - unlike any other.",1
238314," Smart, lively, funny, raunchy, blessed with two terrific leads and a writer-director with real style. The downside? It can't entirely escape its rom-com tendencies.",1
201304," Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students...and came back with the astonishing revelation that ""they wanted to see something that didn't talk down to them."" Ignoring that, he made Swimfan anyway",0
54076," ""Calvary"" is often wound tightest in the most unexpected places.",1
122954," ""Clouds Of Sils Maria"" swirls with provocative ideas, but they're talked about more than dramatized ...",0
131774, Her is a gorgeous fable about the way technological innovation is always a crapshoot and about the way such inadvertently violent changes can poke at the human heart. Jonze navigates such tricky spaces with a warmth he's never before shown.,1
170312, Don Jon is like watching a far more well behaved Jersey Show. It takes the same beats presented on that awful reality show and polishes them for a more compelling and complex experience. ,1
168141, Wish You Were Here may always be thought of as the movie that first gave us Emily Lloyd. Or as David Leland's first directing achievement.,1
175601, Want to know what happens when an A-list director and A-list movie star attach themselves to a direct-to-cable screenplay? This.,0
228434, Watching Leguizamo dance to the 'The Show' and compete in a 'who's got the bigger chainsaw/penis' contest was certainly funnier than Vince Vaughn in a short skirt or Reese Witherspoon trying to figure out how a breast pump works.,1
36013," An overrated film. DiCaprio gives a great performance as a mentally retarded boy. It's so good, in fact, that's it's difficult to watch.",0
138037," There's a people-are-good feeling permeating the film, which is difficult to resist.",1
191339," In a sense, it's a horror picture for the selfie generation - fitting, as the narrative is utterly vapid and shallow.",0
216848," Disney has a good hair day as the revamped story of Rapunzel leaps from the screen, and not just because it's made in 3-D.",1
64306," If it's not a completely satisfying film, it's not a completely mediocre one, either. See it if the subject matter intrigues, or you're a fan of one or more of the actors.",0
159250, In the Name of the King would be irredeemable if not for its near-brilliant ability to give the viewer douche chills for 127 solid minutes.,0
155746," The characters lack charisma and it's impossible to connect with them and for that reason, one doesn't care if they live or die. In conclusion, it fails to fulfill its primary purpose of entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]",0

217625," This morbid, visually stunning fairy tale gives you plenty to think about and plenty to be entertained by.",1
165921, Could go toe-to-toe with the very best of Rock's standup. The movie he's been working towards his entire career.,1
4125, Bleak portrait of a brilliant but drug-addled jazz pianist.,0
169459, A movie that runs out of people to kill very quickly and seems in a huge hurry to be over.,0
249354," It's so lacking in heartfelt frights or cheap scares that the few real hair-raising moments, in the finale, don't pay off.",0
104574, The spy-game maneuverings provide some dramatic heft.,1
10649," In the hands of director Berg, who specializes in quick-cut, adrenaline-pumping action, it's a well-made, sometimes horrifyingly realistic re-creation of events -- but it often feels like a formulaic disaster film.",1
227110," Thomas Bezucha applies just the right light touch to the film, layering in strong dollops of wit, wackiness and warmth, making it among the best of its type.",1
77488," This is Hitchcock for a tabloid audience: simplistic, judgemental, smug and pat. Rewatch the actual films instead.",0
228319," Though dark and harrowing, explicit and unsparing, the movie proves a riveting biography of these burnt-out icons and their iconoclastic half-decade.",1
230388," Maleficent leaves most ends dangling sloppily, much like the creepy crawlies that hang from the trees in Aurora's enchanted forest.",0
133110, A post-apocalyptic tale that is nothing more than an ad for patriarchy and dualistic thinking.,0
127143, Kung Fu Hustle is made with such infectious humour and gee-whiz visuals it's easy to simply surrender all over again to Chow's brand of lunacy,1
12783," It's a toss-up between Kleenex and the sick bag at first, but later on the plot veers into improbably stupid territory and it's best just to bail out altogether.",0
215418," Masterly acted and suspenseful vengeance flick. . .Plummer is brilliant at conveying constant changing states of mind, from avuncular...into avenging angel...to befuddlement.",1
179705," More how Harry met Sally than when, the above average Definitely, Maybe may not be destined to be a great comedy classic, but this valentine earns every sweet and believable moment.",1

1731," Wilson lurches jarringly from poignant melancholy to cartoonish slapstick, unable to settle on a consistent tone.",0
144346," There are so many frantic pursuits through heaving streets that it is easy to lose track of who is chasing whom, or why. Energy and urgency are substituted for realism.",0
180620," Not only as good as any American thriller of the past several years, but boasts a totally unique premise.",1
170417," [Roberto Benigni's] an irritating goofball at times, but there's a genuine sense of tragedy and darkness -- of the most ancient traditions of clowning, in fact -- underneath it all.",1
68222," It's an emotive film about an emotive incident, but an unmolested account of Grant's demise could have had so much more impact.",1
66882, Another astonishing true story gets the Hollywood treatment and ends up being rather flattened in the process,0
193800," Despite Ahsoka's cloying presence, The Clone Wars is still easier to take than Attack of the Clones.",1
127764, This film details a character portrait with a unique style and is headlined by a slick Phoenix doing solid work. Even if the odds are poised to stack against the narrative. ,1
78123, An episodic chain of high-octane set-pieces that gets increasingly winded as it drags on. ,0
205556," It is unfortunate that the film is as diagrammatic as an algebra equation. Actually, I believe that algebra is more terrifying than old Pennywise. ",0
58994, The movie stinks. It doesn't stink in a clever or interesting way. It's not even so bad that it's funny.,0
80751, An endearing blend of myth and melodrama that forthrightly explores family abuse in its own society.,1
75598," As the intrigue heightens in The Favourite, so do the film's surreal touches.",1

234477," Unreels with smooth pace and unexpected grace notes, both visually and by its two leads.",1
150877, The rich landscapes and colours just jump off the screen at you in the best possible ways. Each character has such unique features and expressions that make them truly stand out.,1
66086, Best left for the festival circuit -- which is where we suffer through the indie-style artifice so you don't have to.,0
88582," A marked improvement over its predecessor, The Purge: Anarchy is a scarier and more effective thriller that also features a solid central performance from Frank Grillo.",1
202469," As it stands, this version is still an enjoyably solid watch, but it's just not the ambitious masterpiece that it could've been.",1
108127, A jagged but memorable feature... that slowly yields its truths.,1
163147," At no point does anyone in the film even vaguely resemble an actual 21st-century teenager; when these kids text each other, it comes across like science fiction. ",0
170448, We're left with the nasty taste of our own bloodlust long after the credits have rolled.,1
248906," McKinnon brings in the franticness, but it's not the same thing as chemistry. This is the kind of buddy movie that has the characters telling each other how much they love each other, instead of letting us feel it.",0
54262, ---- a truly inspirational film ----,1
122460, A monument to wonder and excitement for all those still in knee socks or short trousers.,1
157248," Ridley Scott is such a fine craftsman. His cuts and camera moves, his sound blasts, are all in service to the story. And this is a really old one. ",1
511," An energetic, amusing and resolutely feel-good-film-with-a-message, 1960s music movie The Sapphires ticks all of the right boxes to click with audiences as well as being a smart advert for Aussie girl power.",1

118545, The constant appearances of the almost-dead indicate how out of ideas this premise holds.,0
94180," Crowe's a delight as a crafty Deputy Dawg from Arkansas; Mark Strong's Hani has an IQ to match his GQ. Surprisingly, the only undernourished part belongs to DiCaprio.",0
129221," ""Here Comes the Boom"" is so full of clichés from other, better movies that it is almost plays like a parody of an underdog tale.",0
84782," Despite its title, 'Prime' doesn't earn terribly high grades.",0
166660," An intimate, confidently directed and superbly acted humanistic drama utterly at home in the subtle push-and-pull of long-standing family tensions and arguments.",1

183192," The film strives to truffle out of entanglement without too much grace or rhythm a series of powerful situations that, tied to the weight of insight, would have aspired to impact. [Full review in Spanish]",0
51640, I spent most of the movie admiring Pacino's discipline in the role instead of believing he was the character.,1
67886, 300: Rise of an Empire therefore becomes a tedious slog of repetitive callbacks not only to its predecessor but also itself.,0
34655," The pleasant but forgettable ""Adult Beginners"" strains a bit too hard for a happy ending, and tends to lay on the schmaltz and metaphors (like the swim class that gives the film its title) with a trowel.",0
177280, Taika Waititi has found a way to balance his offbeat sensibility with a maturing humanity.,1
74186," The Skeleton Twins is beautiful, infectious and painfully honest in a way that's normally reserved for someone that you shared a womb with.",1
185628," So much of the success of the film is in the mood, and the sense of constant restraint on the part of Haigh. He's always holding the reins, forcing us to study the scenarios he places before us through Charley's innocent eyes.",1

244782," There are moments of goofy, B-movie fun (certainly more of them than in the much-worse A Good Day to Die Hard) but not enough to get over the brutal nonsense that makes up most of this action flick.",0
45153, In Clint's vision of the Old West all parties are tainted by violence and the need for revenge.,1

81591, Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie give performances fit for queens in the surprisingly timely period drama Mary Queen of Scots.,1
202302," If nothing else, ""Beloved Sisters"" is one of the most visually striking biopics around. Too bad you have to wade through so much verbiage in order to enjoy it.",0

174967," The story elements are fairly well balanced, but it's hard to shake off the feeling that, even in a philosophical fantasy world, women remain mere distant helpmates, and men do all the fun stuff.",0
178830," Free Birds is unappealingly staged and paced with an uneven sluggishness. It begs the question: since things always seem to be happening, why is it all so crushingly dull?",0
4665," End of Watch is one thriller where the adrenaline rush, considerable as it is, is almost always put in the service of character. Happily, the character on display turns out to be considerable, too.",1
203096, A retread of just about every home-invasion movie of the past 50 years mixed with elements of torture porn and chick-flick romance...has nothing new to offer in the genre.,0

52966," Calm down, people. The Master is a perfectly fine movie... But, no pun intended, this isn't a religious experience.",1
242535," Inventive, intriguing sci-fi indie with mainstream polish is pure allegory - and isn't afraid of the questions it raises or the objections it may incur.",1
220280," Tons of action and butt-kicking, but the story is on autopilot, performances are stilted, and the film's budget can't keep up with director Anderson's daunting scope and scale.",0
247274," The pic functions well as both a prison escape drama and as an escapist film. It's far from a great film, but is entertaining and pleasantly cynical despite being so bleak.",1

24915," The disappointment of Ted 2 isn't that the jokes are offensive ... but that they're lame, tired and peculiarly humourless ...",0
246099," Intriguing, but virtually devoid of suspense. Funny, but pressing too hard for laughs. Monotonous, but not boring...Still, the ambitious Infinity War should be mandatory viewing for serious Marvel movie fans.",1

142731, McQueen is an honest study of a tragic genius.,1
19609," It certainly provides a convulsive, if not cathartic kind of horror.",1
77431," Director Johannes Roberts employs a brutal smash-and-grab burgling of comfort - percussive, not concussive. He leans into a John Carpenter aesthetic and leans on synthesizers and fog machines. The film leaves scars without merely scorching the earth.",1
116325, Spiderwick is The Neverending Story of the new millennium -- a family-friendly fable that kids will applaud but adults may nap through.,1
163080," It's remarkable how charitable, on the whole, this movie feels; in all of the previous examples, the vision of pop and people is at best tangled, at worst jaundiced.",1

104223," While too baldly calculated and on-message to rank with Belvaux's best, ""Our Land"" will see perhaps the strongest returns of his career given the topicality.",1
219794, It's schmaltzy -- but it's schmaltz veined with foie gras.,1
251745," Certainly lives down to its title, which sounds like a caveman giving travel advice.",0
84172, It is a film of such damning emotional trickery.,1
183111, An idealized dream world where ancient warriors suck down massive amounts of helium before they fight and then do silly over-romanticized things like battle in their hearts.,0

157178," Sexy, funny, beguiling, and above all, humane, The Duke of Burgundy does for erotic euro-lesbian thrillers what Under the Skin did for sci-fi.",1
69991," On occasion, the film captures a welcome cross-section of modern New York life, serving as a freeform antidote to the intersecting-lives tidiness of similar films from the likes of Haggis and Iñárritu.",1
153721," New American classic Mudbound is a reminder of the brutality of American history, of the weight of generations of institutionalized bondage and familial racism, and of the possibility of love as survival.",1
57491," If Tarantino's previous films had one foot set in the real world and one in the realm of pulp fiction, this pop culture fever dream represents blissful surrender to unreality...",1
22685," A lean, mean historical actioner which doesn't hold back on brutal realities, mostly succeeding in mixing genres and grappling with weighty themes.",1
183892, The widespread speculation that Exit Through the Gift Shop is a hoax only adds to its fascination.,1
111268, This is another case of micromanaged demographics that end up disappointing all,0
114885," Hot Tub's humour revels in political incorrectness, and that may put some off, but there's no doubt it's an effective nostalgic trip supported by a cracking soundtrack.",1
124253," Blunt and Theron are game but given little to do but strut and declaim. Hemsworth is fun to watch and there are striking visuals, but that can't make up for a dreary mess.",0
154688," A huge disappointment after Baumbach's sublime ""'Squid and the Whale."" Ugly, murky, and mean.",0
48684," You couldn't ask for a more unlikely avenger than the ill-equipped sort-of hero of Blue Ruin, and that's precisely why it's far, far more suspenseful than the typical violent revenge thriller.",1
88046, Any film that causes you to reappraise the awfulness of Couples Retreat has to be pretty bad.,0
32103," It's well worth seeing, even at the risk of making you want to lock your daughter in her room for the next six years.",1

1566, Educational and enlightening.,1
165649, This dreamy tale of wasted youth provides a familiar yet authentic portrait of the teenage experience.,1
101675," Incredibly, once again, screenwriter Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus deliver a movie without passion.",0
30228," All films require the suspension of disbelief, but ""The Book of Henry"" asks too much of its audience.",0
245587," When a movie invites you to question its very reason for being, there's something wrong in the design.",0
81967," Foreboding images abound - crawling lizards, mysterious lights in the sky, a funereal assembly populated by grotesques - along with occasional ambient droning on the soundtrack and moments of mild humor and raw gore. Do the tableaus add up? Not really.",0
248084," As soon as the credits rolled on ""Predestination,"" I wanted to watch it again. It was even more of a mind-dance the second time around.",1
162417," In the future people are going to look at this with the same fascination that we reserve for movies like Plan 9 From Outer Space - yes, it's really that bad.",0

196960," ...Sabotage is wholly unpleasant, unfocused and downright ugly.",0
94591," It's nice to have a movie worm its way into your brain and leave you wondering and wanting more, and for the mechanics of the plot hold up to further scrutiny. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's fake eyebrows, I suspect, would not withstand such close examination.",1
123925," A fine salute to a place that, like Maddin's mind, comes off as a packrat for barely surviving memories.",1
186729," As lengthy and passionate as a drawn-out kiss, ""Beloved Sisters"" is a beautifully made romantic drama set in 18th century Germany that's smart, sensual and emotionally resonant.",1
180393," What it lacks in emotional depth, The Shallows more than makes up for with bite, as well as a knowing sense of its own absurdity.",1
102088, Few people have turned routine daily life into transcendent art. 'American Splendor' exquisitely shows how Harvey Pekar did just that.,1
144746, Unique mix of dreamy Western and Neil Young concert; cursing ,1
19284," ... a series doing little like any others, stretching theme limitations that blockbusters placed on themselves. By design or necessity, Hunger Games movies concentrate on story more than spectacle, allowing a savage antiwar allegory to ring through.",1
200243, A frightening tale about the relationship between fathers and sons. [Full review in Spanish],1

243325," Despite the best efforts of all involved, trying to prise laughs out of How Do You Know is like trying to make concrete float.",0
240561," All in all, it's not quite a misfire, but could have been so much more. Hardy, however, will come out of it higher than ever as he cements himself as a true acting powerhouse.",1

223394," A chocolates-out, phone-off binge of Ted, Old School and The Other Guys will give you more satisfaction.",0
222460, Masterminds doesn't live up to its comedy pedigree. The all-star cast of comedy veterans needed a stronger script to keep the laughs coming.,0
64452, Wordplay captures the exhilaration that comes from navigating the ins and outs of complex puzzles. It also celebrates the English language in a way that is stimulating and immensely entertaining.,1
161659," It's still a very entertaining film, although newcomers would be wise to check out Wardrobe if they want to better understand Caspian.",1
80944," A loose-limbed, mournfully comic western that gets better the further off-trail it goes.",1

146113," [Marc Foster] knows that careful, quiet dialogue, and long, silent pauses speak louder than lengthy emotional summaries. ",1
5500," Too calculated by half and underwritten by about as much, as witlessly unaware of its faltering sense of comedy as its stoner-dude heroes are of everyday reality.",0

211532, A labored comedy.,0

16900," The film has great intentions, but dumb humor and over the top action sequences don't help its cause. [Full review in Spanish]",0
55728, A pleasurably quaint tale.,1
104401," The Ritual, too, on occasion achieves a tense and devilish power, leaving you in the dark with these guys trying to figure out what that thing can mean. In these moments, the forest seems wilder than it is.",1
36231," All in all it's not great, but it's not terrible. Better than Thor 2, I will say that, but I feel like this is one of those movies I'll forget the plot of.",0
212809," The Wolf of Wall Street is a hilarious, angry, and scathing indictment of greed. It's so funny you might not notice how deep it cuts.",1

158786, You'll learn as you writhe along.,1
1491," Thought-provoking points about racial injustice are raised, only to be sketched over by the script. Still, where White Boy Rick hooks you in is as a family drama. ",1

249094, Missed opportunities are everywhere.,0
62317," If kids cared about adults's mid-life crises, Hook would be Robin Williams' most beloved movie. Disney's Christopher Robin may make overworked adults verklemt, but it also may bore children stupid.",0
109747, The nuance and complexity of character that made the first two X-Men movies more compelling than the typically mindless summer blockbuster are gone in X-Men: The Last Stand.,0
175392," Faster is many things; none good. It's a languid, sub-CSI police procedural intertwined with a sluggish revenge flick and drizzled with the inane relationship dramas of a newly married hitman struggling to figure out his work/life balance.",0
55976," Mavor and Whitehouse, both of whom appear poised to break out after a series of smaller roles in TV and indie features, demonstrate a believable chemistry, but more importantly perhaps, a convincing hostility after their breakup.",1

45093, An incomprehensible furball of grungy kids running around screaming.,0
137641, A standard talking-head documentary that leans more on telling than showing. And the telling isn't very engaging.,0

117638," The Road is one of the year's strongest dramas. But it's no picnic, to say the least.",1
182738, It seems more than a trifle obnoxious to tell a story that unfolds in a bubble of Hollywood privilege and to present it as if it were something that everyone could relate to.,0
37867, The Coen brothers have done it again.,1
51984," The film is a Fleshlight. It looks like the real thing, and it might get you off, but it is plastic, phony, and utterly soulless.",0
229846," In this densely populated ensemble piece, Reeves stands out as the only actor whose damaged character evokes sympathy and avoids cliché.",0
244078," It only took about 10 minutes for a wide smile to form across my face at the realization that 'oh, man they got it right!'",1
70523, The Day I Lost My Shadow serves as the perfect example of a film that's in no way contemptible but hard to muster any real enthusiasm for.,0

141819," Scenes with wise-cracking, whip-smart Veronica and her loving father, investigator Keith Mars (a wonderful and thoroughly genuine Enrico Colantoni) are among the film's best.",1
240157," This awful ma-full flick should have been even more honestly titled Lazy Movie. The premise is numb-dumb obvious and the plot barely furthers it. As the movie wears on and on, the moms' bipolar-anxiety about being only 'good' or 'bad' gets stupider. ",0
170069," Anybody who's seen the 1976 film will probably be pretty bored by this one, which is rather like an inferior copy of a painting that was no masterwork to begin with.",0

42247, [T]hose who argue that it's 'better than the first two' are simply admitting how awful those movies were.,0
238803, [Little Man] quickly runs dry of ideas.,0

119005," A much better way to strike home the same green message, while also having more fun, would be to just skip this movie and take your kids to a national park. ",0
220295," ""Dark Money"" restores your faith in democracy, as the little, almost voiceless guys stand up to deep-pocketed muckety mucks to expose how the proliferation of PACs have nearly choked the life out of a government for the people, by the people.",1
40444," The Hunger Games is a very enjoyable futurist adventure, presented with a compelling, beady-eyed intensity.",1
190831," Lost River is little more than ""cool shots, bro.""",0

16125, Everything is just as it ought to be in such a picture. ,1
208097, One very expensive flop.,0
144786," Despite its pluses, ""Indignation"" often plays like a heavy handed after-school special. It's not so much indignant as it is tedious.",0
247370, ...only the most die-hard fans of director Hayao Miyazaki will find something here worth embracing.,0
169304," Death Wish is a remarkable social artefact, a valuable record of the day before yesterday - 1974 - when New York and many other American cities seemed in large part ungovernable. ",1
73814, This is the very definition of the kind of movie where fans of the star will enjoy it more than dispassionate observers.,0
221203, Its most fiendish moment comes when one girl yanks out another's bellybutton ring. Not that -- anything but that!,0
54296, Portman adores Oz's book and its characters so much that she never quite digs deeply enough to bring them to life.,0
233517," Too violent for youngsters and so poorly written it won't engage an older audience, it seems to be targeted towards youthful nerds nursing overwhelming revenge fantasies.",0
216272," A taut, smart and remarkably timely thriller...",1
251755," Pattinson is doing something that should be deliciously wicked and unique, but it somehow manages to be completely predictable in its unpredictability.",0
58597," Promoting a stereotypical image of rural Ireland which would make Father Ted roll his eyes in disbelief, Leap Year is a sappy road movie and frankly implausible comedy.",0
85954," Herzog has made a nearly 40-year career out of following eccentrics and madmen, revealing that even the seemingly insane can have engrossing, vital things to say.",1
140711," Turns Scotty from a horny old goat with entertaining stories into a more sympathetic, even tragic figure (but the stories are still fun).",1
223021, The film's setup is much more interesting than the overblown payoff offered by Hackford and screenwriters Jonathan Lemkin and Tony Gilroy.,0
62144," It's not a great movie or top-notch entertainment, but it does tell a fun enough adventure to regain faith in a saga that had given clear symptoms of burnout. [Full review in Spanish]",0
221899," Forget the Freudian analysis ... All you want to know: Is it scary? Yes, especially when Sally ducks under the sheets and comes nose-to-nose with the gnome leader. Think ""Sixth Sense"" scary ... ",1

2385," There's admirable craftsmanship in the use of sound, music and light, especially in the final stretch, when skies glower with magic-hour hues and sheep bleat worriedly.",1
162562, I'll recommend it for what it is: a far-too-real disaster film. Bring the tissues.,1

223952," Chicago 10, Brett Morgen's semi-animated, semi-documentary attempt to make the '60s cool for a new generation of kids, does the opposite.",0
213101," A tour de force of subtlety and restraint, 45 Years is the perfect movie to see alone if you've just broken up with someone and want confirmation it was a good idea.",0

176797," There is an unspoken emptiness that hangs boldly over Foxcatcher, which is sure to be one of the subtly darkest films made by a major Hollywood studio this year.",1
238865, The detective ducks into a movie theater and finds himself watching a (heroic) film version of himself. His response - a snicker tinged with melancholy and disdain - speaks volumes about the futility of trying to dictate how we will be remembered.,1

131246," I wouldn't go so far as to say I would watch Dwayne Johnson read a phone book, but an Archie comic or the back of a cereal box wouldn't be out of the question. As for watching him in something as generic as Skyscraper, that's a tougher call to make.",0
149095," The film's chief interest isn't plumbing philosophical questions of fate, providence and autonomy but, instead, wallowing in skimpy fairy-tale romanticism.",0

36121, (The film) failed to ring true for me...Too many of the sexual situations struck me as contrived.,0

190192, ... lives up to its promise and premise... the benchmark for this summer's blockbusters has just been set.,1

112974," I was repelled by the two-ton subject matter, but drawn in by the beauty of its delivery.",1
142689," Even at a short 77 minutes, Primer is bloated, draggy, cumbersome, confusing, and almost entirely unengaging",0
15706," Burns argues for a cogitating, agitating Warhol: deep thinker, cultural barometer, and world changer.",1
220771," All the actors are good, but Harrington is remarkable. It's not just the physical changes in her character, but the genuineness with which she inhabits her.",1
180879," Not only is the movie vile and callous, but also it's pretty darn stupid.",0
143437, Is there anything more tiresome than watching people play video games? Seth Gordon's documentary The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters answers that question with a decisive yes: watching a movie about people playing video games.,0
94644," Unfortunately, their largely improvised dialogue is not enough to sustain even the meagre 79-minute running time.",0

24323," A waste of time, money, effort and talent - and yet another reminder that games and film are two very distinct mediums that rarely should or do coalesce.",0

120981, interesting concept but poorly executed,0
208216," Goes up for the dunk but misses the rim, the backboard and the point. Instead it manages to strike out and get sacked at the same time.",0
161969," For all his attention to detail, Weir misses the big picture. Master and Commander resembles nothing but a lovingly crafted, multi-million-dollar ship in a bottle.",1

25799," You may be repelled, in the moment, by its oil-and-water mix of tortured sentimentality and creepy puppet play. You might also find it damnably hard to shake.",1
239424, A cartoony and messy narrative that is mostly style over substance.,0
129735," Another director would have made an uplifting picture about a great American success. Scorsese, instead, has made the only picture he could, risking studio millions on an intensely personal epic about a dark, complicated failure.",1

3463, The role leaves Fassbender naked in front of the camera in ways literal and figurative.,1
6976," Much of the silly, half-baked humor is based on the smug idea that watching clumsy stoners being high is amusing but, unless you're joining them, it isn't.",0
152109," Except for the occasional Christopher Walken as Captain Hook oddity, Peter Pan Live! became a dutiful, perfectly fine, surprisingly dull evening of television.",0
210039," The puzzle of how the various personal and narrative pieces will eventually fit together exerts a smidgen of interest, but the characters are so dour and un-dimensional as to invite no curiosity about them.",0
92041," Chastain is one of the day's heavyweight screen presences, capable of counterbalancing Sorkin's bulldozer storytelling methods with her charisma. ",1
122667," The script never jells; the comedy feels forced and mechanically boisterous, particularly in the crucial early passages. And in the final 30 minutes, it's a dangling mess.",0
161228," As the clock ticks on, the sharks thresh and the dialogue continues to stagnate, you might just catch yourself wickedly thinking: Come on sharks, let's do this.",0
134946," In exploring the genesis of iconic female superhero Wonder Woman, writer-director Angela Robinson has crafted a film that is as empowering as it is entertaining.",1
243562," The acting is cartoonish and the gags are mostly lame, suggesting that Woody's antics are best enjoyed - or endured - in small doses.",0
128281," When you think you know its moves, it throws in fancy footwork. Then it sucker-punches you when you're not looking.",1
198446," As a three-dimensional character, it's hard to say that it's good to see him again. But as an action hero driving a Dodge Charger off a ramp and onto a speeding SWAT truck? Welcome back, old friend.",1
37838," Over-the-top and mostly preposterous, Catwoman just might be the Mommie Dearest of comic-book-based movies.",0
203447," Minus Patricia Clarkson's pitch-perfect performance, the lovely to look at but monotonously paced Cairo Times would wind up less satisfying.",0
219672," The tongue-in-cheek, slapstick comedy gets the job done - it ensures ample laughs.",1
200502, Twilight is a must see and a must for a sequel. Can anyone say New Moon 2010?,1
122299," So why, why more American Pie? It's a lame one, just the same one, now with much older guys. And starlets wearing mileage from all their whiskey and rye. Singing ""Why did my career go 'bye'?"" ",0
71862," Intelligent and entertaining, Runoff moves its audience from what was perhaps a vague, wistful notion of the rural existence of family farming to witness the harsh realities of a tragically disappearing American way of life",1
102493," Lonergan found the right man in Affleck, standing stony-faced while others weep, his performance a master class in submerged feeling... But it's Williams who stuns, in the course of a single, astonishing dialogue toward the end of the film.",1
235964," A simple story, beautifully enacted, perfectly crafted, there is not much to fault in this film. Exemplary cinema by any standards.",1
168895," Mary Poppins Returns is ... nice. And that's perfectly OK. While the movie may have had aspirations to be more than that, the truth is that nice is enough. ",1
116970," Amusing and impeccably designed and photographed, the latest work from Wright, Pegg, and Frost comes across a tad undercooked, as though the creative team was backed into making a movie instead of triumphantly mounting one.",1
223328, Runaway Bride works its way into some genuinely compelling emotional territory that Pretty Woman didn't dare acknowledge.,1
122117," A comedy with dark edges and a melancholic center... McCarthy gives a fine-tuned performance, her outsized comic sensibilities channeled into in a non-farcical, three-dimensional character.",1

170028," Director Eli Roth's remake of the 1974 Charles Bronson movie (both based on Brian Garfields' novel) is not only awful, it's also incredibly thoughtless, with a brutish, simpleminded argument. ",0

175995," Divertingly ridiculous, headbangingly noisy.",0
221271, The drama brims with religious allusion and questions of how faith manifests in a world without hope.,1

34238," [A] cacophonous, half-digested mass of pop-culture influences.",0
232462, There's a lot to like in this movie. This is why it's such a shame that the whole thing was ruined by a few minutes of footage.,0
162222, This year's live-action offerings are unusually strong across the board ...,1
29932," In fact, whether you find it a piece of harmless, escapist fun with a gorgeous cast or two hours of cultural genocide filled with creepy robo-teens will depend on whether you're under or over 14.",0
231013," [Maleficent] has one very good idea at its core, but a lack of narrative drive and the soulless, state-of-the-art look of the whole thing keeps director Robert Stromberg's debut feature from ever blossoming into something genuinely interesting.",0
66879," An adept, muscular entertainment that never for one moment lacks for dramatic clout.",1
222414," Sometimes we see Blake through the window, but, as he moves around the room, often we see nothing but the far wall. Depending on your perspective, this is either incredibly gutsy or incredibly boring.",0

4830, Boulevard is as empty and anonymous as its eponymous stretch of road.,0
104736," Despite its failings...a hugely influential movie with literally towering design, mordant wit, and a hall-of-fame performance by Jack Nicholson.",1
134446," The film is a guaranteed tearjerker, but more than that, an uplifting tribute to a single woman's quest for independence that would surely make Bridget Jones blush.",1
219697," It's jaw dropping at times, the level of obsession exhibited by these chicken people, and illuminating to realise that there is a whole big world - a very big world - full of show chickens and other poultry.",1
86813," At the very least ... this blizzard of oddity marks Haghighi out as the joker in the Iranian auteur pack, and every gang needs a wildcard.",1
34387, It's clear Bay doesn't give a thought to the story and sees it merely as a clothesline on which to hang his massively ridiculous action sequences.,0
74790," It also turns out that [Gary Ross's] style, or lack of it, is the uneven Ocean's major liability.",0
10163, There's actually lots to like here: phenomenal special effects and some truly astounding 3D sequences...,1

80778," Even if you haven't got kids, give it a sneaky viewing for some fun and to marvel at Uranus.",1
245305," Visually, which is where this 'Alice' really radiates, there are many riches. Ken Ralston's visual effects are stunning and surreal; Colleen Atwood's costumes are dazzling; and Dariusz Wolski's photography is spot on.",1

93083," A stealthily engrossing work that should appeal to viewers who haven't seen, say, Affliction. ",1
194224," Ultimately, the biggest disappointment of Hugo is that it fails to make the case for 3-D as a legitimate tool for the serious filmmaker.",0
141506," Every time it seems like it's going to move forward, its absurdist themes are instead rerun in a continual loop with steadily diminishing comedic returns.",0
107688," There are moments of wit, fear, imagination and grace that one remembers over the years, but they are scattered among the long drawn-out, meandering narrative.",0
58495," Ice Age is cool and if you want to shield your kids from the sun for a while, this is one diversion they'll love.",1
182196," Often it's a thin line between genius and madness, and director Danny Boyle just tips the balance the wrong way with this psychological heist thriller.",0
150911, David Lynch might have made something subversive out of these off-putting elements. Winterbottom has no idea what to do.,0

230775," Dead Man's Chest has every appearance of an epic adventure, but not the soul of one.",0
44160," The film is overrun with characters, but it's less interested in their identity than their plasticity.",0
217646, This adaptation of the late Canadian writer Mordecai Richler's playfully experimental novel about a man making sense of his wasted life feels rather like its antihero: inadequate.,0
101605," The actors are uniformly handsome and mostly serviceable, though the same can't be said about the filmmaking or the writing.",0
53681," There's a good movie here about the peculiar bond between men of different social strata, but Lennox and his screenwriters, John Cairns and Michael McCartney, never quite locate it.",0

194976," Exactly like being trapped in a shack with three smiling, happy-clappy Evangelical types for two and a quarter hours.",0
43783," An intense, hard to watch drama, of a man's life torn apart by his fellow citizens. The performance is skilled enough that it won the top acting award at last year's Cannesfestival.",1
8739," Overstuffed and distractible, this episodic redo feels like a couple episodes of some Showtime series stitched into a feature ...",0
120432," A tantalizing melange of dreamlike riffs on the desolation of the American west, the empty poses of male ritual, and the blood lust of macho fetishism.",1
185088, The main thing one takes away from this 82-minute crash course in dumber-than-dumb humor is how amateurish and poorly produced the whole enterprise is.,0
242503," Though the movie is not without a few stereotypical western tropes,... at its best it's an interesting story written by John Fusco about two men struggling with the deceit of image and the betrayal of reality.",1

211673," Thanks to the superb turns from Michael and young Bill, plus a witty, well-observed script, this is a real slow burner of a film-incredibly moving but brightened by some top comic moments.",1

134542, One wonders if Zemeckis knows what kind of story he is telling. [Full review in Spanish],0
185808, Both the story of Fawcett's adventures and his family life are effectively told by writer-director James Gray . This is the kind of movie that makes you want to research the people and events depicted and find out more about them.,1
191105," Clearly hoping to capture an old-school feel, the movie is just too long and too cliched, bordering on ridiculous towards its end. Even the soundtrack, which swells to epic heights as often as possible, feels cheesy rather than stirring.",0
170337," If you don't want to hug [An Seo Hyun], adopt her, or make her your best friend by the end of Okja, you're a heartless human being.",1
209522," It's virtually impossible to hate the film, but Barrymore's presence behind the camera suggests more calculation than vision; like a lot of actors who direct, she tends to the performances, but her style never rises above bland proficiency.",0
110605, Nice little film with a pleasantly sad tone,1
231162," What starts out as a delightful black comedy and social commentary ends up, at best, as a guilty pleasure where I had a hard time sorting out the intentional from the unintentional laughs.",0
116673," If only there were an Oscar for inanimate objects. The Post would be loading a wheelbarrow full of hardware home on awards night for Meryl Streep's spectacles and an old Xerox machine... Sadly, the emphasis is on the artifacts, not the emotional drama.",1

53585," For all the spellcasting, there's very little magic in this movie.",0
82465," Feig spins it in a light, comedic vein that borders on genre parody. But he also can't resist capitulating to the clichés at which he's poking fun. ",1
186920," It's crazy, dangerous and sometimes gorgeous: a feast of nuttiness that takes you, for a while, over the edge.",1
235453," Look, I know it's full of clichés but it's such a delicate film. It won me over completely. It's so authentic. ",1
69106, Don't even attempt to solve the puzzle; just stay away from the Escape Room.,0
151120," Thank heaven for Dwayne Johnson, whose foot-wide smile will not be switched off, and who saves the life of the movie. Whether it deserves to be saved is another matter.",0
80120," The New York City of ""Shame"" is a place so cold, so distanced, so removed from flesh-and-blood humanity, that it's the only place a man like Brandon can truly be alone.",1
130559," Intermittently amusing, distinctive, not always easy to digest",0
226220," It's impossible not to resent the puniness of this picture's concerns, ignoring the historic environmental catastrophe in favor of fictionalized feats of derring-do by an underwear-model-turned-hamburger-franchise-mogul.",0
238648," The situation is suspenseful and unique enough to hold our attention for a time. Well in advance of the picture's climactic moments, however, it deteriorates into melodramatic talkiness.",0
106987, Leaves no cliché unturned; it's Old Jack City.,0
243938, A compelling document that works as a mini-history of black racial identity in America from the mid- to late-20th century and beyond.,1
161189, There is not a lot of plot -- lest we forget that simply living is its own story -- with the film instead growing increasingly existential and even experiential (the exquisite animation and sound design is quite transporting).,1
87729," The editing is shockingly bad, the green screen is some of the worst in recent memory, and the characters are so underdeveloped it seems inappropriate to use the word 'characters' on them.",0
219495, Three food fights and a funeral. ,1
200511," What emerges is a fascinating and illuminating story, one that runs the gamut from intense joy to deep sadness and features a couple of surprising twists that take proceedings off in strange and unusual directions.",1
86680," A talky bore that reduces the original film's pontificating -- about the nature of 'reality' -- to windy, fortune-cookie philosophizing.",0
96572, An artful unflinching analytical doc on the devastating civil war in Syria that won the top prize at Sundance.,1
189941, Bay doesn't whip up many edge-of-the-seat moments. Maybe that's because it's difficult to generate real suspense when the series -- like this movie -- feels as if it never will end.,0
220115," As if playing a serenely refined game, Hou transforms constraint into freedom -- which feels more to the point than any plotbound interpretation.",1
227268," Kurzel's pretty, remote Macbeth is one of those stage-to-screen translations that never quite leaps to life. It is recitation more than adaptation.",1
107817," Even with extensive use of the rewind function on my VCR, I couldn't piece the story together",0
107287," The film is nearly devoid of the sense of mystery and wonder that usually permeates Desplechin's work, and features only a meager handful of his signature expressionistic interludes.",0
36932, Attack the Block's attempts to straddle horror and comedy are doomed: it's neither scary nor funny enough.,0

21408," J. Edgar connects with viewers on an emotional level, charting the man's complicated love affairs-with his mother, his secretary, his deputy and his country.",1
214398," Made on the cheap with no-name stars, this is no better than a stilted anachronistic curiosity, a low-rent version of the eighties' prime-time soap Dallas, with the industrial concerns and sexual mores of 1950s, all, somehow, set in 2016.",0
33723," This is an ambitious attempt to tell the story of World War I's most notorious fighter pilot. But while the events are truly momentous, with thrillingly rendered aerial combat, the film is let down by lacklustre writing and direction.",0
92252, It seems Dark and writer Dan Madigan have no better grasp of insect reproduction than they do of filmmaking.,0
120626, The film is so self-conscious it seems to be dictating your every reaction.,0
164877," Failed effort though it may be, I liked watching this film. The thing is easy on the eyes, for starters, but I also admire the go-for-it level of foolish ambition here. Say what you will about Angelina Jolie, but she's not playing it safe.",1
88005, I had fun. But I could have had more.,1
112348, I want to see Kutcher play a serial killer without a conscious and with his own hair. Enough rom-coms that take place in another universe!,0

210558, Can you say 'cinematic atrocity' boys and girls? I was afraid you could. This has a place in the Sequel-For-Sequel's-Sake Hall of Infamy.,0
52415," Although the film is labeled a comedy, it hovers on the dark side in so many shadows that it is rarely amusing. Yet it never has the courage to fully explore the havoc a real Oedipus complex can wreak on the lives of real adults.",0
168236, This feeble comedy ranks about an 11 on the yawn-o-meter.,0
86701," A perfectly satisfying entry in the long history of Disney feature animation, one that will in due course join the ranks of the middle-tier classics if not the legends.",1
8557," It's a movie that needs to look down its nose for its laughs, which generally isn't the best place to find them.",0
24018," Wrath radiates the straight-forward, straight-faced pleasures of the mytho-muscular epics, like Hercules and Jason and the Argonauts, produced in Europe a half-century ago.",1
206581, Sophie Goodhart's My Blind Brother has clear eyes on full hearts.,1
218139," Had it not been a true story, we could have questioned the audacity of the events. Perhaps, that's what makes Raazi one of the finest films of 2018, triumphant and defiantly good.",1
3349," The film occasionally meanders and the story it tells isn't nearly as interesting as it's namesake...but if you're trying to out-duel Mr. ""Dom Hemingway"", you'll probably lose anyway.",1
151428," Early on I thought I could almost smell the sharp must of the leather bindings ... but that scent was just the aroma of middle-brow, art-house Euro-rot, a whiff of decay and hauteur.",0

142807," Lots of sizzle, not much soul, and very little sense.",0
96580," Never brave enough to feel far-reaching (or, ironically, far-fetched, when time-travel and space flight are so popular at the movies), Navigator still fulfills its mission, distracting the family for bang-on an hour and a half.",1
228964, Bruce Willis sleepwalks his way through yet another generic role in Steven C. Miller's Marauders; a muddled and a painfully formulaic actioner which fails to offer anything even remotely original.,0
94885," ""Frost"" is not only severely hobbled by the almost complete absence of drama and characterization, but is also delivered in relentless, claustrophobic, tiresome medium-to-close shots ...",0
77563," Although it's definitely a fictionalization of a true story, they get the essence of this insanely crazy double life that these kids led as they were breaking the bank in Vegas.",1
48140," When the film turns to new material and characters, it's fun to watch. There's just not enough of those new comic moments.",0
41627, Certainly a film shown during the anniversary of that sad time should make you feel something. This one doesn't.,0
32926," If Alison Chernick's ""Itzhak,"" a documentary about the great violinist Itzhak Perlman, had a musical tempo designation, it would probably be ""A capriccio"" (Italian for ""following one's fancy"").",1
107921, Now You See Me 2 is a desperate attempt to pull a franchise out of thin air. But this glitzy Hollywood hoodwink is nothing more than a slavish pull of wool over the audiences eyes.,0
113582, It has a Rolls with spinning hub caps - what more do you want?,1

220237," A magical documentary recounting the 35 tumultuous years of the Glastonbury Music Festival, this is an exhilarating experience.",1
91515, This big-screen venture from the comedy team of Key and Peele might have worked better as a sketch on their eponymous television show than it does at feature length.,0
236814," There was too much riding on Ginsburg's ideals, and her causes, for their treatment to be quite this cute.",0

200179," Gonzo, hyper-violent, sometimes amusing. But a redneck 'Pulp Fiction' ought to be funnier than this. ",0
195362," Assorted dark sides clash, with both heartbreaking and repugnant violence. Summoning sympathy when not terror, for this artificially enhanced manimalized yet broken man. In any case, Twilight fans especially, it is not recommended to try this at home.",1

64191," An outright blast, so fun it's -- pardon -- scary.",1
46054," This film feels like a torturously overlong TV episode, and it takes itself so seriously that it has none of the camp value of the original film or the show's sword 'n' sorcery competition.",0

45212," The ending is also nicely ambiguous, as befits a film that is drama rather than romance. It's a powerful little punch to go out on.",1
11835," Dreary, flat, oversimplified, uninspired. Surely the failure of Oldboy will prove many right who decried this remake years ago. I wonder what a more nuanced, imaginative director might've done with a script that wasn't dumbed down for the masses?",0

27244, A wickedly entertaining blood feast.,1

96203, Black Panther feels like the right movie we need... right now. ,1
160607, But the film doesn't just find a clever way to refresh a maybe-calcified genre. It also overturns some of the genre's more puritanical tendencies. ,1

77883," The gangling script shows a compulsion to swerve away from sentimental expectations, but only manages to mire itself in affected anti-cute misanthropy. ",0
159124," It doesn't feel like a normal espionage thriller; it feels much, much better.",1
191743," The film's only other notable ingredients, sadly, are the most rumbling soundtrack since Earthquake, a lot of jaw grinding by Ben Affleck, some narrative confusion remarkable even by director Zack Snyder's standards, and... hours and hours of your time.",0
72809," Even after twenty years, Child's Play shows no ring rust. The little flick plays just as well now as it did in its heyday.",1
174303," ""The Dressmaker"" wants to be a saucy and absurd tale of small town scandal, only to then attempt to try and turn the story completely inside out.",0
163725, Often as likable as a frolicking puppy -- and always as messy.,0

170983, It's a downer to see so much effort expended on such junk.,0
70901, What's most startling about the movie is the gale force of its love story.,1
10746," Dominating almost every scene, DiCaprio is an extremely attractive actor, but while perfectly capable of projecting Hoover's occasionally nutty side, he has far too much leading-man charm to make an audience shudder. ",0
221084, A frightening number of people are going to recognize themselves in this movie.,1

92632," Despite its intimacy, the film doesn't generate much emotional resonance.",0
4238," Not only has he hauled Rourke from his self-pitying slump, but, working from a screenplay written by Robert D Siegel, he has created an often-brutal, always-compelling portrait of a decent man trying to peel himself off Skid Row.",1

3617, A highly enjoyable summer thrill ride.,1
108769," Even if the action is too whizzy for its own good, it has a sense of scale that makes it eye-catching. And the script's exploration of identity and power is actually meaningful.",1
84687, Watching Paul makes you wonder whether Edgar Wright wasn't the one who kicked Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's previous films up the notch needed to give them their bite.,0
101685, Two people sharing sublime moments of uncool.,1
167219," Exactly what it says on the label: a deliciously overwrought melodramatic love story, capped off with one of the greatest special effects achievements of the 1990s.",1
144317," Lavish attention to historical detail, the thorough immersion in this unusual world and Johansson's impressive performance make Girl With a Pearl Earring memorable but not a masterpiece.",1
90349, Blanchett conjures up a crackling caldron of colliding conflicts with one of the most memorable female protagonists Allen has ever written.,1
55281, Another fascinating character study from French director Patrice Leconte who has proven himself quite adept at plumbing the depths of the human psyche by placing a couple of people with nothing in common in an emotionally-explosive predicament.,1
130034," If Sandler is truly determined to soften his image, his persona in here is an acceptable compromise.",1
133664," Doesn't have the quilted complexity of Allen's best work, but unfortunately that's nothing radically different from what we've recently seen from the esteemed writer-director.",0
58512," Buttermaker is ornery but strangely resigned, smart enough to know he's settled for a crap life, but too exhausted to do much about it.",0
162068," Perhaps the greatest testament to Eastwood's directorial skill is that such an unattractive, brutish game could serve as an uplifting symbol of communal harmony and renewed national spirit.",1
240335," Moore shines the camera on the changing political system in America, where neither Democrats nor Republicans are absolved.",1
234293," A minor flaw or two but assuming you don't spend all of your days barefoot like a Hobbit, the movie will knock your socks off. ",1
30689," Beyond Skyline becomes an enjoyably loopy thrill-ride, full of sudden shifts and turns. ",1

168719," This flawed, fractured fairy tale fails to scare up many chuckles or much charm. As Ebenezer Scrooge himself might say, ""Bah, humbug!""",0
237265, A core of substance and a fine cast are squandered in the relentless hard-sell perkiness of this mild comic drama.,0
135910, the film is too distant and too shiny to thoughtfully reflect on contemporary French cultural issues,0

232229," Nothing gets explored at length, and some key points are glossed over altogether, namely Héctor's out-of-wedlock son and his frequent womanizing. Such factual details would demoralize Puchi. They are merely mentioned, then ignored.",0
241966, Who'd have thought a Danish soap opera would be as bad as an American one?,0
9452," Eventually when the action ending shows up, I thought, ""I could play that video game."" Otherwise, 'Immortals' is a waste. ",0
138446," An uneven, intriguing adaptation of David Foster Wallace's book of short stories, the film and its bits-and-pieces structure ultimately don't add up to as much as hoped.",0
145793," The 40-Year-Old Virgin is too long, too sexist, and too -- shall we say -- flaccid.",0
211005," A lazily executed dud padded out with infantile pranks, shambolic plot turns and knockabout action.",0

220985," Thou shalt be funny. Thou, in this case, isn't.",0
162954," While some of the effects are alright, the Nemean lion that Hercules battles in one scene looks comical. Hercules, looking like a beefcake at a toga party, starts using his superpowers only towards the end of the film. Too little, too late.",0
32615, ...something that should please school-age viewers and should be tolerable for parents who may accompany them.,1
82346, A sensitive but surprisingly unmoving portrayal of the friendship (based on a true story) between a Los Angeles Times writer and a troubled street musician living on the streets of Skid Row. Jamie Foxx gives a standout performance.,0

192394, There's little doubt that Traffik gets off to a decidedly (and palpably) underwhelming start...,0

149498," It is proof positive that this emperor of comedy has no clothes, a fact that he seems depressingly eager to demonstrate throughout.",0
74066, A film that can't decide what it is...but Colin Farrell and David Tennant know what they are. So that's something.,0
25705," As Yates halfheartedly shepherds ""Beasts"" towards its inevitable sequels, there's only one real surprise: that the screenplay, by Rowling herself, is the weakest link.",1
57075," The worst things about Basic Instinct, though, are the explicit ""love"" scenes. They're supposed to contribute to a heady equation in which sex, violence and psychology are fused; instead, they're gratuitous, exploitative, and entirely unerotic.",0
74273, What began as a tale of innocence lost ends with a sense of exciting discovery. Because the lesson to take away from An Education is that a new star has been found.,1
236176," Against the Night is better than swallowing Tide Pods, but only just.",0
155919, An odd subtitle for a movie with all the insurgent energy of a senior dog splayed in the sun. Yet another fiscally and creatively timid sequel returning only the affordable actors and pandering to China by casting its national stars in nothing roles.,0
199629," Charming, funny and highly entertaining.",1
97111, I've watched this film four times and I still can't believe what he did or what I'm seeing. Each viewing intensifies the galvanising joy and the heartbreakingly unrepeatable nature of his walk.,1
157863," [Cruise] oversees some pretty impressive stuff here, from the drones that ping-pong around in the air to the bubbleship that Jack uses to go to and fro to that awesome house with its panoramic views.",1
86881," There is nothing to recommend here; as a creature feature (mostly) missing its creature, The Sand is an arduous watch.",0
129937," A choreography of blows turned into a form of fine arts. And with Charlize at the center of it all, even more beautiful art. [Full review in Spanish]",1

229513," In ""Magic in the Moonlight,"" the debate is between rationalism and faith - what you can see with your own eyes versus what you're willing to leap into the dark for - but it's given a trite, cursory treatment.",0
171025," A fantastic cast, lighthearted tone, and fun soundtrack make Suicide Squad one of the most entertaining films of 2016.",1
246849, Unsettling and so off tone that we wonder if we are supposed to be laughing at this at all. ,0
214149," You often have the feeling that simple, truthful stories of the men and women who serve overseas are underrepresented on screen. Not this week.",1
66161, One can't help but wish for the film Sleeping Beauty might have been had Campion held the reins. ,0
130631," The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch, but a great movie it is not.",0

53645," Take Open Water, subtract the Caribbean, substitute the Grand Canyon, and you have The Canyon.",0
36728," An uninspired, scattershot disaster romp that mostly serves the talents of one half of the marquee pairing, underuses the other half, and struggles to blend R-rated humor, foreign misadventure, and an oil-and-water mother-daughter dynamic.",0
194651," One thing that's indisputable about Big Bad Wolves: It's a slick piece of genre craftsmanship, a stylish, drum-tight thriller that magnifies the ugly extremes of crime and retribution.",1
128313," Bohemian Rhapsody fancies itself like the song, ranging a gambit of genres at an inexplicable fashion and expecting its audience to love the certain absurdity of it all.",0

142087," McAdams can turn up the charisma and make (almost) any role grounded and watchable, even multiple ones involving time travel and memory loss. Tatum is like a very handsome steak.",0
23239," Extremely well-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Let me repeat. Extremely well-written and directed by the man who counseled Cruise in ""Jack Reacher."" They apparently click.",1
124670," With its weak plotting and production values, Smell of Camphor, Fragrance of Jasmine will test the patience of the most forgiving filmgoer.",0
154845, A lively but meandering doc that is more seduced by the scene than some viewers might like.,1
148921, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have made a delightfully simple film that is now a rare American entertainment: a slow character piece driven by strong writing and good performances.,1
148801," The simplicity of I Am Not a Witch and its musical contrasts seem like they wouldn't work, but it creates an effective thread... [Full Review in Spanish]",1
157190, Candor and poetry sustain this excursion. [Full Review in Spanish],1
175153, Funny and full of energy. ,1
96436," The Incredibles 2 is a animated spectacle that edges out its predecessor in nearly every way; but most of all, in pure entertainment value. ",1
134982," A change-up delivery from a director seeking relief from his artful image, the movie wants to catch our ears rather than our eyes, and it does so without completely reeling us in.",1
22214," Ronan is excellent and the costumes are lovely, but that's just not enough. You find yourself wanting a whole lot more.",0
230412, ...an utterly forgettable horror effort that has no place within a film festival's roster.,0
164349, How can someone mess up the story of America's most celebrated sharpshooter this badly?,0
248874," Cleverly shot guerrilla-style in Disney's Florida and California theme parks, this offbeat thriller is an exercise in relentlessly inventive filmmaking, vividly proving that pure imagination can overcome a micro-budget. ",1
46724," Trank's debut feature treats the audience to a deluge of teen angst, power trips, comradeship and rivalry yielding an insightful look into the unstable machine driving humans' wills and desires.",1
94528, Ang Lee and his creative associates are involved in an experiment of cinematic alchemy -- turning the equivalent of lead into gold.,1

133626," Not only among the year's worst films, but it marks the rock bottom of Eastwood's output as director. ",0
132077," It's movies like The Normal Heart, fuelled by the performances within it, that make you want to learn more and provide perspective on one of the bleakest times for the gay community. That, and increase Kleenex sales at Costco.",1
204588, A film that feels every bit the product of its purportedly ruthless and artistically corrupting milieu.,1

52000," As teen movies go, it's supremely sophisticated, capturing and crystallising that moment in adolescence when it seems that life is at last about to start and the only place you want to be is elsewhere.",1
50196," On the surface, it's a story about a troubled teen, but there are so many layers that it becomes much more than that. It is a story about life.",1
197195," The movie is a colossal letdown on almost every front, but in some ways, it was to be expected considering the magnitude of what DC and Warner Bros. wanted to accomplish only two films into their shared universe",0
208473," This is a cinema as rich as life itself, a distillation and decoding of the language of gesture of which our existences are comprised.",1
191845," HB2 is so completely idiotic that at some point, if you're willing to play along, you accept it for the uneven piece of excrement that it is. ",0

121547, Upbeat first-rate musical documentary that proclaims it is through music that the world might best be able to connect in a peaceful way.,1
65141," In wine, human greed found an unregulated commodity and a means of garnering huge returns. It also paved the way for opportunists to abuse the system for their own gain.",1

130781, Rarely does the idea of death elicit the warmth and utter charm as it does in this documentary.,1
231104," An immersive, you-are-there experience that is as dramatic (or more so) as any Hollywood feature film.",1
57693, [An] emotionally rich and honest drama that makes for a quality big-screen experience for demanding grown-ups daring to go back into theatres once the summer's silly heat has died down.,1
221723," We get a brief dip into his family's past and emigration from Israel, but the filmmaker never digs deeply enough to reveal any other substantial dimension of this man, or her theories about what shaped him.",0
165303," [Screenwriter Andrew] Bovell and director Anton Corbijn keep us guessing about motives, especially Karpov's, until the last moments.",1
168795," This is that rare film capable of holding even the most boisterous and fidgety of audiences in stunned silence, all the more impressive when it's while a room full of CGI apes are communicating via sign language. That is cinema.",1
156101, Taken on its own terms the utterly imbecilic Jackass 3D must be judged a success...,1
6595, Mungiu's fascination with modes (and codes) of behavior gives his period piece a resonant universality.,1
239994, Recent events give the documentary The Island President both an urgency and a poignancy.,1

104193, Bahrani's most accomplished film to date.,1
199527," Moving, beautifully acted '50s-set drama about secret love.",1
63187," It's a wondrously silly premise, and one that Lanthimos executes with rigorous illogic and immaculate formal control.",1
125668," Reitman must be aware of the potential for innuendo, and the leap of faith such earnestness asks of its audience. He dares us to care.",1
201711, This is one independent hit that could probably benefit from big-budget studio treatment.,0

100040," An intimate drama with a rattling emotional core, a film about loss, despair, redemption, and the little moments in life that make all the heartache worth enduring.",1
217956," Still lively and likeable, despite the sprawling techno-bloat and general over-stuffing. ",1
139259," Do we really need another franchise with a tall-ish, ""42""-year-old vigilante drifter cracking heads? Probably not.",0
219473," With very little to differentiate [itself] from dozens of other movies meant solely for young girls, Ramona and Beezus certainly shows potential to be a better movie than it is.",0

58613," For its terrific wildlife action and sweet human scenes, the film is overwhelmingly worth seeing.",1
178957, No one is going to explain any of this for you-and the slightly snobby implication of Upstream Color is that explanations are for suckers. ,0
54773," In short, this movie is what the Star Wars prequels should have been, and that's meant as high praise indeed.",1

230729, Jonze has produced a gorgeous $80 million Muppet Movie in the shape of an art film that will bore kids as much as it will depress adults.,0
81329, The creepiest aspect of Departures -- dead people -- ends up being what's most beautiful about it.,1
181953," The flavours, though lovingly prepared, don't always compliment one another. Perhaps it's because when we get to the 'and then the unthinkable happened' portion of the documentary, the lack of balance left an odd aftertaste. ",1
21047, Sits on the screen like a steaming lump of Kryptonite.,0
156361," If you've managed to elude Tolkien's siren call over the years, this is your chance to catch up and fall for it once and for all.",1
66016," A sunny, colorful Australian Aborigine musical sounds like a good idea, but Bran Nue Dae is a very slightly plotted, over-the-top film with hammy acting suitable for an old Benny Hill episode.",0
60319," Characters are more than a bullet point of traits, which Mile 22 time-after-time tries to subterfuge.",0
184432," ...a pasteurized memory, dressed up with the dapper black and white photography of Guillaume Schiffman... [Full review in Spanish]",0
52867, An enchanting tale from Tim Burton that weaves together reality and myth so touchingly it hardly matters which is which.,1
68212," By the end of Gone you'll be convinced that it's just a low-rent reworking of The Silence of the Lambs, with Seyfried's humongous peepers a sad substitute for Jodie Foster's acting chops.",0
15547," Despite the heavy handed metaphor use, the not as obvious journey getting there is sweet and worthwhile.",1
152279," [The Fountain] doesn't make for smooth, comfortable viewing, but I'd much rather watch somebody shoot for the moon when the stakes are sky-high than sit back while they play it safe.",1
11439, Comes loaded with a relatively big budget and a line-up of talking heads more powerful than a meeting of the Bilderberg Group.,1
135284, Thank God I live in newish construction.,1
123792," ""Beyond"" is undoubtedly messy, like a Starfleet ship that's taken its fair share of beatings, but it is frequently a reminder of how good the series can be when all its engines are in working order.",1
8291," Fueled by a decidedly American formula of can-do crazy, The Astronaut Farmer feels, for all its libertarianism, a little lost in space.",0
102788, 8 Mile is entertaining to an extent. Our enjoyment is muted because the movie has an agenda.,1
179222," There is no profound drama here, however, so you might end up resenting the film while it drags from you the emotional responses that the sight of anxious little children inevitably triggers.",1
116454," It's loud, alternately garish and boorish and is going to hack off literary connoisseurs, comic book lovers and movie fans alike.",0
172843," And that honesty comes down to Fisher's performance. The brilliant sound design helps punctuate her spot-on comedic timing, but the drama is hers alone.",1
80701," Dupree sustains its groove for the most part, and in this summer of bloated spectaculars, it feels tight. It may be silly, but it's a pleasant enough diversion.",0
239223," Never before has ""Ghhrrrrr"" meant so much or conveyed such depth of character.",1
251557," 127 Hours may be occasionally overdirected, but it's never under-felt... and more importantly, Franco's work goes a long way toward making Ralston's story live. ",1
114046," As the morally conflicted and mentally distraught Matt King, Clooney gives what could be regarded as the most well-rounded and emotionally raw performance of his distinguished career.",1
65015," Released in America as Jenny Lamour, Henri-Georges Clouzot's story of ambition, murder, mystery and cover-up -- and their all-too-human foundations -- holds up remarkably well.",1
209751, The worst kind of independent; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors,0
24653, A film for all seasons.,1
71584," [I]t's a compelling way to tell a story, but in keeping us at a certain distance from its characters, the movie never connects on an emotional level.",0
207316," Ferrell polishes his screen image as an oversized, oversensitive man-boy out of place in the adult world, and Duvall does a low-comedy, geriatric variation of his Great Santini character.",1
47199," For all the would-be with-it cyber/techno-speak, strip that all away, and Gregory Hoblit's film is completely stale and cliched thriller nonsense.",0
55108," The spectacle? Brilliant, as you'd expect.",1
163025, A solid social thriller. [Full review in Spanish],1
49171," Finney's a superb storyteller, dominating the film as he lies immobile, and McGregor has precisely the right blend of cockiness, enthusiasm, zeal and charm.",1
89160," It's an opaque performance from Tautou in many ways, understandably so, and perhaps the film does not fully get inside her mind and heart; a confident, robust work nevertheless.",1
228245," This time, the words really should be believed: a massive return to form for Woody Allen. No lie. At this rate, we might even forgive him for Cassandra's Dream.",1
75008," Consciously avoiding a Dreamgirls vibe that suggests their failure was a showbiz tragedy, Neville lets his subjects unabashedly strut their stuff.",1
31022," Push falters not in trying to add its voice to the genre, it falters in not having anything compelling to say.",0
124645," If there's a facet of The Front Runner that justifies the film's seemingly purpose-void hand-wringing about protecting liberal icons, it's the central performance by Jackman.",0
250232," It's immensely silly and, for the most part, nowhere near scary enough, but with James McAvoy quite clearly having an absolute blast it's still a funhouse ride worth taking.",1
99907," Like the worst superhero movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron often feels like not-very-bright kids playing with action toys, holding them up by the ankles and making them fight or kiss or feud at whim and at length. ",0
100100," The movie does have humor, even if it lacks a snappy pace. And in certain moments it soars.",1
16026, Far more frustrating than the film's banally conventional plot structure is its characters' lack of depth.,0
159748, A meticulous thriller based on a large-scale conspiracy within the German army to assassinate Hitler.,1
88413," The movie doesn't cop out into cheap melodrama, never turning the hijackers into cardboard villains and never glorifying one passenger or crew member over the others.",1
41118," Ben Stiller's aesthetics blend overly manicured imagery with soaring rock songs that underline every emotion, lest the film's corporate logo-driven message-making didn't get the point across clearly enough.",0
213287, The Big Sick finds plots by losing them. That's its genius. One moment we are in an ethnic satire; the next a romcom; the next a hospital comedy-drama. But that's existence.,1
30687," ""The Intern"" is like one of those candies you put in your mouth that starts off tasting sweet - until it suddenly turns lip-puckering sour.",0
72766," After a run of brilliant films that have deftly plumbed the dark side of the human soul, this new comedy makes it clear that Almodóvar remains one of the wildest, raunchiest and most hilarious directors of our generation.",1
245244," Ultimately, Ichaso's passionate helming and its stars' deep commitment make El Cantante (The Singer) worth seeing, despite the film's unmistakable missteps.",1
165605," [Woody] Harrelson, from a different part of Texas than Johnson, just nails this role, even if the makeup job is a bit jarring at first. You get used to it and completely succumb to Harrelson's talents in transforming into the 36th president",1
246344," If you're looking for 100 minutes of pure escapism, get on board. ",1
248352," One life down, eight to go.",0

229589, Twelve and Holding unfortunately breaks down by trying to wrap up its problems too neatly.,0
81977," After several years of ""torture porn"" horror flicks, Funny Games sets the counter back to zero, reminding us that torture isn't fun, isn't stimulating, and isn't something we should be getting off on.",1
177919, It is of my opinion that superhero movies are supposed to be super. Green Lantern is merely ordinary. ,0
246465," For mature audiences who have forgotten how to smile, it takes up where The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel left off.",1
107628," The component that stayed mostly the same is the writing, which is bad news to me, since my main beef with the original movie was exactly that.",0
54188," Not one of the works in this anthology movie sequel cracks 10 minutes, so they barely have time to overstay their welcome.",1
178723," It's a diverting, moderately successful approach, but hardly the best use of all the talent in front of the camera.",1
115270," Mostly comprised of banal, drama-free, quotidian scenes that merely reinforce the men's status as regular Joes who, one day, had the opportunity for greatness thrust upon them.",0
246638," Peele once more shows that he is a better writer than director. This work spills over with themes and symbols, just not coherently arranged, nor presented in a visually stylish way.",1
190193," Attempts by director Chris Weitz and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg to inject more humor and lighten the tone go horribly awry. (The supposedly ""serious"" dialogue is funnier than any of their pop-culture references and such.)",0
33013," In a just world, everyone involved in this mess would be required to perform some sort of public penance.",0
14566, A moving and worthwhile tale.,1
196573," Too grim for the average fan of crime pictures, and too brutal for many viewers who might appreciate its matter-of-fact portrayal of the lives of many PTSD sufferers.",0
54514," Lawrence ... thrives here, but even her skill and determination can't stabilize a film that goes off in any number of directions and rarely feels confident about the kind of story it wants to be telling.",0
234707," Hardcore delivers creative action sequence after action sequence, and it's almost as fun to think about how they managed to choreograph and shoot the battles and chase scenes as it is to suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride. ",1
184213," This movie is cloaked in prestige and indie-cinema trappings, but it's really not much different from the crappy middlebrow tearjerkers that Hollywood floods our theaters with.",0
27107," What's left is an awkward blend of tragedy and comedy, in a movie that doesn't feel as if it has earned the right to be either.",0
69588," At the end, the film flirts with bathos, but it's been absorbing enough along the way to maintain our good will.",1
38004," [Shia] LaBeouf makes McEnroe his own, while costar Sverrir Gudnason does a remarkable approximation of Borg, right down to his walk and hockey-derived backhand. ",1
78611," It's arguable that Nyoni is stretching a thin premise, but this film is one of the obvious breakouts of the year: exactly the kind of young work-brash, committed, and narratively unpredictable-that film festivals are supposed to champion.",1
131194, How did they convince Kerry Washington to be in this mess? Talk about a scandal!,0
88494," It's unsubtle filmmaking, laying out every nuance for us and playing around with some pretty serious ideas without digging very deep.",0

153744, It's difficult to get too excited about yet another so-so TV adaptation.,0

13462," It's perfect for parents looking for harmless entertainment to keep the young ones engaged during the holidays, but less than perfect for anyone else.",0
237977," There's a world of difference between a movie that makes you want to rave about it, and one that feels like you're watching it from inside a rave.",0
220337," Easily a step up from the last two films thanks to McMurray's stylistically brutal direction of the action sequences, but you can't help feeling that this concept will work far better as a television series",0
248223, A painful story that needed to be told.,1
209089," ""Girl Most Likely"" is a strange movie, in that it has the atmosphere of a comedy and some extreme characters set up to be comical, but there are really no funny scenes.",0
241031," Crowe, a former journalist for Rolling Stone, does know music, and the soundtrack is good. The on location Hawaiian settings are also nice to look at. However, there is little else here worth recommending.",0

41309, A crushingly perfunctory literary adaptation.,0
207839, Early Spielberg film shows a real talent for suspense.,1
142986, It's the gay-panic-a-lympics!,0
203033," Cast Away is, in many ways, a bold, adventurous bid for Oscardom. Unfortunately, what it delivers for audiences, as opposed to Oscar voters, is a little questionable.",0
45490, You can predict the end of the film in the first five minutes but I will say that the dogs and the gadgets were pretty fun to watch.,0
243554," Extravagant in movie terms but stingy in emotional ones, it embodies all of Spielberg's bad impulses and almost none of his good ones.",0
28107," It's fairly serious stuff, perhaps because the movie was thoughtfully scripted by Maria Maggenti, who wrote one of the best-ever movies about adolescent girls, ""The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love.""",1
113203, Johnson's brilliant move is to center his sci-fi around a basic human survival drama.,1
161889," I don't think I've had more fun at a movie theater in a long time. The whole viewing was spent tapping my toes and trying not to sing aloud. Heck, I even wanted to clap after each number!!!",1
87003, A bittersweet winner-driven by the strong performances and sharply observed nuances in both McGowan's script and direction.,1
72475, This mild and dawdling picture is the sort of trifle meant for a retirement-age audience who just want to spend a pleasant and uneventful hour-and-a-half with a few name actors of a certain age. There's very little comedy here and even less action.,0
77239," Noisy, dark and headache-inducing, John McTiernan's Basic is one of those brain-twisting legal thrillers that can only be enjoyed by those determined not to worry about things like consistent internal logic",0
125586," A chilling, disturbing portrait of the dangers of the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the evil of deceit.",1
63420," Stylish, arty and quite enjoyable.",1
41776," Efron, frankly, lacks the comic agility required for a role this nimble; he's as elastic as hard plastic.",0

208406," It's easy to dismiss The Artist as a simple love letter to the silent-film era, but there is a lot more at work here than just an attention-getting gimmick.",1
249526," What ""Bruno"" may lack in setup innovation, character conviction or ""Borat's"" inherent sweetness, it makes up for by pushing things beyond points of comfort or, in some cases, personal safety. Successfully uproarious in slaying social stratification.",1
65278," The actors' way of reveling in their stagey gestures, sooty makeup and silly accents becomes increasingly pitiable.",0
38885," The cast is anchored by two wonderful actresses: Imelda Staunton and Rebecca Hall, whose talents are squandered on this lackluster horror drama.",0
48438," Secrets and lies is the name of the game, in other words, as this taut but sinister ensemble piece turns the screws in what is an intelligent, all-engrossing - and indeed Irish-produced - film.",1
120976, ...so stuffed with pop-culture references that if you removed them the entire movie would likely collapse.,0
31067," This new adaptation of the Shakespearean play is very odd looking, like a modern film done on the cheap, in an ancient language, viewed on a 60-year-old television set.",1
200117, Enjoyably swervy.,1
145124," It is a warm, friendly movie, smooth and sensual in all the right ways... What a wonderful surprise of a film.",1

158758, It's hard not to read the film in racial terms and the result is a confused mess of mixed signals that substitutes a brutal climax for any kind of satisfactory resolution.,0
26492," Every time you hear or see Notaro perform, you're reminded that you'd likely be getting a greater insight into both her work and her personal life by seeing one of her ace routines rather than by sitting through ninety minutes of ""Tig.""",0
78164," Even as it deals with big themes, the film is never pushy or melodramatic, letting events unfold to gently convey a powerfully challenging message.",1
248920," Teetering between weirdly mesmerizing and inexplicably clumsy, D.J. Caruso's film offers a worthy investigation of voyeurism, as it pervades current popular culture in the form of reality TV and user-generated internet videos.",0
148828, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a poor attempt to give a twist to a classic romance story. [Full review in Spanish],0
210315," A lukewarm thriller without the depth, impact or meaning one expects from an Oscar contender.",0

49311," Finding Forrester is Gus Van Sant treading water in Hollywood, but he's making a beautiful pattern.",1
240103," There's no estrogen whatsoever in The Hitch-Hiker, as spare and muscular a picture as the 1950s ever produced.",1
130129," ""American Made"" is a smart, nervy film, a very modern entertainment made with energy, style and a fine sense of humor that keeps us amused until gradually, almost imperceptibly, the laughter starts to stick in our throats.",1
212357," A tender, bracing fraternal drama of London's gang life, the immigrant experience, and questions no smaller than what ""manhood"" might mean to young men whose traditional cultures are colliding with the worst-and the best-of the secular west.",1

172456, In the end the title seems to refer to the filmmakers--and the audience--rather than the characters.,0
151218," The gross-out humor lacks edge, the guilt never kicks in, and the outrages are predictable. It's one flat brewski.",0
75600, Another dull indie road movie that doesn't really go anywhere ... little more than a vanity project that wastes most of its better-than-average cast.,0
98014, This movie feels more like an actor's reel than a cohesive narrative. ,0
164809," t's as cheap and nasty as it's designed to be, and effective at keeping us freaked out right to the nerve-wracking climax.",1
105140," Playful, irreverent and loads of fun.",1
34856," ""great stars in a mediocre comedy-drama""",0
100544, makes a better platform for a beginning astronomy class than action-packed thriller.,1
69581," Painstakingly made using a stop-motion animation style similar to that favoured by Tim Burton, My Life as a Courgette is not at all as grim as it sounds, and focuses more on hope and kindness than the dark starts to the children's lives.",1
89872," Avoiding a precise beginning, middle and end, Cutie and the Boxer instead adopts a collage-like approach. Edited to accentuate the rhythms of the family's daily existence, the movie rests on small moments.",1

239158," I can think of worse ways to spend a morning with a pair of handcuffs, but only if you've been arrested. The plot's easy to guess even if like me you've forgotten the previous instalments apart from the food. The sex is dull. Even Johnson can't save this.",0
960," Ms. Thierry plays Marguerite with an understatement that can be enigmatic, seductive, or deliberately confounding. The picture as a whole doesn't do justice to her committed performance.",0
157127, Them isn't all that.,0

219922," Buster's Mal Heart isn't a light watch. If you don't make an effort to keep up, the movie will leave you in its dust. Those patient enough to untangle Smith's topsy-turvy narrative structure will find an underlying beauty in her work.",1
161437, It is a great premise with some mirthful moments but slight and lacking the depth or insight you might hope for.,0
11638," If you have ever loved and lost, you will relate to this film about the emotional turmoil faced by a couple whose bliss is shattered by a fatal accident.",1
222469," Although the film is profound and moving indeed, one does wonder how a viewer of a certain age might respond to it.",1
177453," The characters are interesting as caricature, but not as real people. There is no one in the show that the audience cares whether they live or die.",0

184572," At once ambitious, familiar in its multi-stranded storytelling, and suspect in its underlying politics.",0
123413, Designed for audiences who will throw their weight behind the film's schmaltz and sentimentality. Anyone unwilling to commit to the movie's shamelessness will feel like they've hit the ground headfirst. ,0
78087, a reasonably benign picture of Carter begins to develop - he's more likable for his moments of pettiness and pique.,1

219474, ...fans won't be disappointed by this big-budget sci-fi opera.,1
1659," What kind of world do we live in when a massively talented actress like Jodie Foster becomes the comic relief character in a kid's movie and is called upon to pretend to vomit (twice)? It doesn't ruin Nim's Island, but it doesn't help.",1
74364," ""Ride Along 2"" is a catalog entry in Universal's library, and a line number on a ledger, packaged to hopefully deliver a predetermined return on investment. If that sounds exciting, just imagine how much fun the movie is.",0
178451," In a 40-year career in horror, David Cronenberg never dreamed up an image as chilling or stomach-churning as Dana Carvey as a human turtle.",0
154010, The masterful level of craft in the film is obvious.,1
71493," The result isn't bland, but it's not exactly Bond either.",0
141702, I greatly enjoyed it and would watch it again ...,1
171359," Making 'The Revenant' was an ordeal, you see, in which people froze and suffered and came to blows, and they'd like to pass the ordeal on to you, the viewer.",0

126756, Isn't half bad because you sense the filmmakers approached a limited concept with the right amount of fun and dedication in mind.,0
152011, You can't deny the fun of seeing Depp retro-construct a muted version of his Vegas mugging like De Niro riffing on Brando's Don Corleone.,1
168845," You'll cackle at Christine Baranski's crackling dialogue, cry when Meryl sings 'My Love, My Life', and when all is said and done you might even be tempted to go again.",1
87344, ...high-octane nonsense for those who suffer from permanently arrested development. The fact that it is a big-budget blockbuster based on a toy really says it all.,0
48195," It's a movie that showcases director Curtis Hanson working at the very height of his craft, but only to break even.",1
7072, Bella expends so much effort hiding its agenda that it doesn't have time to give us a story until the very end.,0
38183," You can surrender to the skill of the filmmaking, and the nuanced performances of the ensemble, but nonetheless it's not an entirely convincing picture. It doesn't get a grip on you.",0
60377," an affectionate recreation of Shaw Brothers kung fu, but for all its inventive weaponry & varied fighting methods, its heady mêlée of sex & gore, its grand gestures and nostalgic stylings, it is also entirely lacking in any real substance of its own.",1
182460, The Eva Peron of pop is now a maid in Maid in Manhattan.,1
170749, It's severely imperfect ... but seeing Stewart continue to use her abilities well and as a tool to create an interesting dynamic makes the film worth watching.,1
163606," Lily Lane is a dark, haunting journey over well-trodden, grim ground.",1

21510," Knight of Cups is a film that feels it has something important to say - much like a twenty-year-old college student who has tried weed for the first time - but in reality, just like said college student, it is speaking nothing but gibberish. ",0
72148, The lesson of this likable little movie is that it's never too late to reclaim your integrity.,1
248370, a below average crime story saved by slightly above average set pieces,0
96598," With a deliberately wistful style, this romantic drama never quite convinces us that its central couple is actually in love.",0
220873," Like Willis, this franchise is obviously aging, and like Willis, it's doing so with an oddly brutish grace.",1
109269," As unfortunate titles for cynically commercial sequels go, this one's a doozy",0

90091, Sloppily slapped-together blockbuster wannabe.,0
196412," When crashing the plane is the only answer to a hijacked plane, when piling all of your luggage onto a bomb is the only solution, and when a heart condition is used to explain why someone likes the window seat, then Non-Stop is the answer.",0
51430," A generally bad time at the movies, and the only significant payoff is a reinforced feeling that Eli Roth is terrified of anyone who isn't an upper-middle-class millennial.",0
198397," It doesn't disappoint in the way of visceral thrills, and for a reportedly low-budget affair, the effects are pretty gruesome.",1
21453, The jokes are weak. There's a complacency to the comedy that suggests that nobody could be bothered. Bean gyrating to Shaggy's Boombastic is a gag that was past its sell-by date ten years ago.,0
110409, Filled with rich ideas.,1
210305," The scope is epic and the achievement, though solidly grounded in conventional storytelling, is a revelation.",1
17362," Works overtime to inspire audiences, but relies way too much on pop-mysticism and half-baked artifice to make its point stick.",0
87605," Most details of character and setting, finally, are reduced to simplistic icons, mingling with such over-emphasised bric-a-brac as posters of Farrah Fawcett-Majors, Rocky and Al Pacino.",0

124508, This feature-length commercial for Major League Baseball covers all the cross-marketing bases.,0

130984," Hello Destroyer reminds us of a sad truth; for some players, there are no glory days.",1
157232, The saccharine-coated treatment of people struggling to learn how to forgive themselves and others takes on the ring of sentimental greetings inside a Hallmark card.,0

236236," If you're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger, ENOUGH is just the ticket you need.",1
152825," Hopefully this film will inspire others to either start or continue speaking out about injustices, wherever they may arise. All power to all the people. ",1

135951," To be fair, The Last Knight is about 15 minutes shorter than its predecessor. But it still somehow manages to feel even longer.",0
227446, It's the work of a filmmaker once again drunk on the daffy possibilities of horror filmmaking -- and determined to share that joy with his fans.,1
24885," An exceptional film with its exquisite staging, despite the difficulties in its story. [Full review in Spanish]",1
186852," The film has the handmade quality and intimacy that Jonze so clearly was after, but it lingers too much in a kind of dragging, adult sadness that feels too overwrought for the film's inner child.",0
96693," What saves Ms. Purple are the bits where Chon and his team manage to hit the same subdued note, capturing the character-driven essence of this story.",1
248660," Yes, we have seen this story before, but St Vincent is a warm, enjoyable yarn with just enough sharp lines and laugh out loud moments to see you through.",1
104814," In another director's hands, this subject might have been rife with sanctimony. Instead, Holofcener has made a sly, urbane comedy with several smart actresses who make her acerbic dialogue lively and believable, character-driven.",1
116592," It's not the ingredients that make a cinematic adventure a ""classic epic"" - Australia has all of the ingredients - it's how you cook them and this one is overdone.",0
122070," Schamus and his fellow screenwriters have taken the most pompous elements of superhero comics -- the humorless archetypes, the italicized declamations -- and inflated them until they nearly burst with the strain.",0
1124," If you hold a perverse soft spot in your heart for straight-to-video underdog junk like Ski School, you're going to love Dodgeball.",1
84704," Well, John Rambo's at it again, and here's Sylvester Stallone again. But ""Rambo"" isn't nearly as rewarding as Stallone's recent ""Rocky"" romp.",0

177963, Boiler Room is a very impressive film debut from Ben Younger.,1
229178, It's puzzling to watch someone present her own life in terms of cliché.,0
133205," Dull and perfunctory, this is a crime thriller that sets itself up as a revenge story but can't manage to drum up any excitement or suspense, and precious little revenge, either.",0
206455," It's vaguely like the fascinating Michael Jackson performance documentary, ""This Is It.''",1
222461," As gorgeous as the movie, it ultimately remains a highly detailed painting positioned behind velvet ropes, unable to connect beyond winning craftsmanship.",0
22066, A neat modern fairy tale.,1
131519," With its compelling and original approach to its romance narrative, coupled with Paulina García's nuanced and intuitive performance, the film delicately balances an entire octave of emotions. ",1
249138," ""Hobo With a Shotgun"" is about a hobo with a shotgun. If you are looking for more than splatter, look elsewhere.",1
215568," It's a stylish debut from an artist with a keen sense of visuals, music, and feeling - a finger firmly on the pulse of now.",1
202300, This abhorrent actioner is vulgar auteurism at its most depraved.,0
168956," ""Before the Flood"" is neither dull screed nor stat-heavy pamphlet, thanks largely to the questing intensity of its marquee guide.",1
78646," Some of the moving parts squeak, especially toward the end. But it's still largely a pleasure.",1
40040, Polanski makes an intriguing battle of the sexes out of a filmed play,1
186472, The whole affair is a head-scratcher of bloody-scalp proportions.,0
202247," It's a nostalgic vision of total power of a local minimum that echoes sickeningly with the nostalgic pathologies of the current day, nowhere more than in Win's enthusiastic declaration of his plan to ""make superheroes legal again.""",0

251036, As enthralling as it is emotional.,1
39083," It's a bit hodgepodge, but the three actors are poignantly convincing together.",1
235279," This review is of both volumes, 1 and 2. As an art film, I don't buy it, but viewed as a trashy, soap opera and absurdest black comedy with pornographic overtones, it is entertaining in its own way.",1

59663, [A] handsome but curiously remote Crusades epic.,1
116283," What makes the film stand apart isn't its authentic flavours or visceral performances, but the story's integrity - a rare commitment to truth that deserves to be seen.",1
11960," For any politician spoiling for a fight over Ireland's soft/hard border, Under the Tree is required viewing.",1
35639," Plodding, puffed-up kitsch mistaking itself for profound psycho noir that the source material won't support.",0
221922, The movie is believable and the characters are very convincing. I have to admit that I definitely screamed and jumped with the rest of them.,1
136733," So how's the Mamet Rocky? Fast. Lively. In your face. Very watchable. And, like its predecessors, so bizarrely convoluted it barely holds together on a narrative level.",1
90175," Wild Tales is the uneven product of pure talent, all snapping curve balls and 100 mph fastballs buzzing at your ear. Szifron keeps us off-balance and unsettled; somehow his lack of control makes him more effective.",1
242567," Lantana has more than the usual dramatic quota of unhappiness, but it's alive in each scene, beautifully shot, and directed by Lawrence with fierce care for subtleties.",1

25004, Cranston's accent is Dick-Van-Dyke-in-Mary-Poppins-bad.,0
6962," For two-thirds of the running time, the film is grandly entertaining.... But then, as we get into the climactic battles, the level of wanton destruction becomes excessive, even tacky. ",1
201803," Rauch's character could easily be too cutesy, too cruel, or just too annoying if played by another actress. But audiences will love her particular brand of arrested development.",1
212268, You know a spoof is in trouble when it's not even as funny as its target. All three installment of the 'Twilight' series...offer more giggles than this excruciatingly prolonged public-access-cable-quality sketch.,0
112670," Computer-animated, painterly adaptation of the Newberry Award-winning children's novel is a blunt sword of moral lessons with a character more insufferable than inspiring.",0
249112," ""Rocky II"" represents far more than just a good-looking fight. It's all about trusting in yourself and overcoming fear in striving for greatness.",1
246848, The result is less a comic broadside targeting globalization and media politics than a political Punch and Judy show re-imagined for James Carville and Mary Matalin.,0
27052, It's not a flawed movie because its not Kenny. It's because the third act has no rhythm and grows sluggish and purposeless.,0
102871, Sure to push the buttons of anyone with a shark phobia.,1
140348," Gladiator is quite a good movie -- a big, fat, rousing, intelligent, daring, retro, many-adjective-requiring entertainment.",1
33956," The story's magic realism is so torpid and affected as to make the film feel as if it, like Adaline herself, goes on forever. ",0
229125," Father's Day is a mildly humorous comedy that, though enjoyable, doesn't quite live up to the talents of its cast.",1
46884," Seedy, slogging, self-conscious - yet suspenseful - concluding with Quentin Tarantino-inspired bloodshed and violence.",1
138837," Todd Haynes' resonant period romance echoes 'Far From Heaven,' but Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara elude that film's glossy fatalism.",1
211986, Pelé's ambition and struggles seem superficial and the resolutions too simple.,0
72859," All reports on the death of the historical spectacle, however, have been premature. The genre is back with Braveheart, a film in which 3,000 extras parade and battle to re-create 13th century Scotland.",1
31635, Too bad that heart gets sacrificed to Cosmatos' over-the-top madness.,0
98188," ..about as small as movies get, yet often, unexpectedly, as moving.",1
110014," While Scream has its frights, it feels more like one of those solve-the -mystery jigsaw puzzles than a real movie.",0

177040," The movie never seems to make up its mind but, far worse, it never quite gets inside Betty's.",0
24106," More successful than the likes of films such as God's Not Dead and its ilk. As an example of satisfying dramatic storytelling, however, it falls frustratingly short.",0

45777, Like something that comes to theatres courtesy of a time warp rather than a projector...rather tedious despite Atkinson's oafish charm.,0
93283," A strong effort from Damon/Krasinski/Van Sant. It's entertaining, and heck- you may learn something too. ",1

81745, French-Canadian director Villeneuve rubbed our noses in Pennsylvania vigilantism-gone-wrong in Prisoners ; now he grids our faces further into the smothering sands of American sanctimony.,0
217429," Layton allows events to unfold with a distinctly comedic edge, referencing Reservoir Dogs and even Jaws, which makes his movie both extremely watchable and thoroughly disingenuous.",1
95219," As far as sitcom-cinema goes (and the movie does truly look terrible), you could probably do worse than this -- probably because most sitcom-cinema casts don't allow Robert De Niro, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline to share the screen.",0

31886, At times I laughed so hard I thought I would bust a capillary somewhere.,1
210350," Perhaps at 90 or so minutes, it would have been the Hitchcockian thriller that it isn't at the beginning but turns into. At two hours and 20 minutes, there's too much of the film that feels like reiteration.",0

244687, Maggie's Plan is a comedy drama of Brooklyn manners you will either find delightful (if you enjoy gabby pictures and Gerwig) or monstrously irritating. Four stars gives my position away.,1

6355, This incredibly emotional film looks at one young woman who saw both her brother and fiancé volunteer to fight in the trenches.,1
82012," Having a thespian of Neeson's caliber chopping down burly henchmen with his bare hands creates a pleasant cognitive dissonance for a while, but the film is unworthy of him.",0
217276," Panders to the kiddies, caters to the teens, and tosses in a loser-ethnic-sidekick. The shrugging tone of this 21st-century sabotage of the original novel is summed up by this slogan masquerading as dialogue: 'It's Jules Verne, man-ya gotta believe.'",0

4850, It's hard to tell what's fallen farther: the Farrelly Brothers' career or the institution of marriage.,0

63573," Dupieux's idea, apparently, is that movie audiences are so stupid they'll consume anything, and the more tickets he sells for this arch little piece of junk, the more he'll be proved right. If I were you, I'd refuse to give him that satisfaction.",0

31151," Alas, a sophisticated trajectory is cut short for an outcome that's cringingly earnest.",0
31958, It's a film you'll want to discuss and debate with your friends. The message may not be original but the methodology certainly is. A movie doesn't have to spell everything out for me if I get a sense that the filmmaker is offering me something to ponder,1

76734, Flatlines in its last half hour and barely putters along in the hour and half before that.,0
199800, Spider-Man is fun again.,1
150300," The film moves like a pyjama case full of angry weasels, and finds ingenious ways to cram every scene with just one more loopy, disposable gag or slapstick thwack. It may not be the year's best animated film, but it's almost certainly the most.",1
157765," Cruise is a little out of his range but that works oddly well, giving him a little frisson of uncertainty underneath the Terminator-like singlemindedness of the character.",1

73453, There is not a single moment in the entire movie in which we are able to guess what [Huppert] will do next -- and that's what makes Elle such a wild and surprising ride.,1
79523," Lixin plays up the atmospheric underclass misery in service of a beautifully shot, heartbreaking vérité narrative about generation gaps and culture clashes.",1
224283," Certainly the story is contrived in places and the tone only just manages to resurface after an early plunge, but if you're willing to go along with it and get involved, you'd have to have a heart of stone not to be at least a little charmed.",1
71104, Highly polished and impressive in every way except that it has a synthetic heart and mush for brains.,0
16476," There is, however, despite the intensity of the acting, an obviousness to the scenes as they play out in what often feels like real time.",1
164844," As sappy and Lifetime-y as all this sounds, Eastwood's skill with the performers keeps Million Dollar Baby afloat. ",1
93598, The only way you should be seeing this movie is on a dare.,0
56610, It's a roaming slice of life chronicle that isn't that interested in plot though it has some. It's more a memory of a feeling.,1
234593," The sheer amount of chuckles in the script is enough to make you forget that Intolerable Cruelty is somewhat arbitrarily put together, never building the rhythm that would have made it into something memorable.",1
22287," As with Love is Strange, Sachs shows his love of little moments, nuanced behaviour and unforced, if occasionally forceful, performances, with the turns from the lads oozing with naturalism.",1
240490, Mann has directed The Insider with a pulse-quickening panache that heightens the tensions within its story.,1
235214," Boseman more or less gives the movie to Jordan and to the many beautiful, brilliant women surrounding him.",1
40415, Remake of much-admired 1960 drama about a maid who becomes her wealthy employer's toy and the dark consequences that ensue has some Chabrol and Hitchcock stamped all over it but not much underneath.,0
176123," One of the weakest competition entries at Sundance Fest this year, this pseudo romantic-erotic feature promises more than it can deliver, and after a cute beginning falls apart.",0
99738, At least it might work as inspiration for DIY film-makers to prove they could do better.,0
51621," Live Free or Die Hard's goofy generation-gap gambit pays off decently and proves, again, that nattily dressed terrorists are no match for Willis, the once and future Patron Saint of Bang.",1
158974," Disregard your personal feelings about the military, U.S. involvement in foreign wars, or a French director making a movie about Americans. This film is raw in the truest sense, yet refined in its sympathy and scope.",1
8150, The secret triumph of A Quiet Passion is to foreground the poet's instantaneous wit in front of the more stuffily serious things about her personality.,1
207063," A romantic drama with a scruffy integrity, ""Maudie"" is, for better and for worse, an actorly exercise in presenting an audience with two willfully peculiar characters and then trying to find a way to make us fall in love with them.",1

37752, Who needs heavy analysis when all you want is a cute fix?,1
124791, Kingsley and Hilmar ensure we believe this by delivering three-dimensional performances we're used to seeing on the heroic side. ,1
812, This is a film that manages that rare bridge between end-of-days epic and intimate humanist storytelling - fantastical but still just rooted enough to be depressingly plausible.,1
202618," Director Jeffrey Levy-Hinte pads out the concert footage with not always stimulating backstage stuff, but the music makes it all worthwhile.",1
173710," As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type, more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script, which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else.",0

226420, Claude Miller's swan song not only shares its main character's name but also her tempered disposition.,0
123266," It evokes the original and takes into consideration how audiences have changed since then, which is a minor miracle, I suppose, and it is light years better than the nine films in between.",1

159453," If you saw any boxing film in the last 30 years, you'll see some of the well-worn plot turns coming a mile away, however it's worth stepping into the ring for all the fine performances.",1
97242, The worst film of the year.,0
69637," Like all Quentin Tarentino movies, this feverish Jews-take-out-the-Nazis-during-World-War-II movie is really all about Quentin Tarentino. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing.",1

168237," If you actually go into this picture attempting to find any common sense in its plotline, you might want to have your head examined afterwards...",1
46223," The hard-hitting film makes most other school-based films resemble child's play, as careers and futures of both the teacher and student hang in the balance, in the uncaring hands of an indifferent system.",1
215923, You could put Garner in a Taken/John Wick-style high-concept action-thriller annually and I'd show up for each and every one of them.,1
230948," The creator has not absorbed any lesson of his first film's weaknesses: The zeitgeist has changed considerably since the 1990s, not to mention the fact that the four women are simply too old for such silly escapades.",0
5245," Making full use of the panoramic possibilities that film allows, Norris has widened out his perspective to up the emotional stakes while also deepening one's sense of an enclave that risks erosion from within faced with the prospect of a murderer.",1
110425," The irony of guns for fish isn't Darwin's nightmare, it's Tanzania's.",1
240606, The film hurts like hell as we sit on the edge of our seats enveloped in tension,1
119373, ...a decidedly middle-of-the-road Disney effort...,1
222256, Low quality even for Seagal's standards.,0
24277, I'm still not sure whether the entire concept is audaciously praiseworthy or pretentiously misguided.,1
199636, Just ask someone you know to put a sheet over their head and suddenly run at you. It's far cheaper and much more memorable than the grainy gimmick being pushed by The Ghost Dimension.,0
200328, Even director Gregory Hoblit couldn't transform Untraceable from a mediocre horror movie into a compelling thriller.,0
77717," Peter Bogdanovich's She's Funny That Way is simultaneously everything one might expect and a complete surprise, a film that contains all of the strengths of the director's past work in a completely new form.",1
14680," Public Enemies is, at its core, a fascinating portrait of criminal narcissism.",1
91375, Both characters are the kind of people who want to be left alone. That`s what you may feel like after you spend a few minutes with them. ,0
9573," A mishmash of epic action, close quarter combat, and family drama that feels neither grand nor intimate, just confused.",0
246783," Doesn't just depict a quantum leap forward in human consciousness  it practically requires such a leap, on an individual scale, from the viewer.",1
195206," ""The Witch"" isn't merely a throwback to a different time, but to a bygone cinematic age wherein the horror genre was not about jump scares but about a more lastingly shuddersome, thematically juicy potency.",1
59929, A monotonously grim portrait that's more rewarding in theory than execution.,0
37527," [Flight Plan] may not win Foster another Oscar, [but] it manages to remind us of how entirely commanding a screen presence she can be.",1
94320," Peter Segal directs individual sequences with a steady hand, but slack editing and a meandering and muddled plot make the film seem slow.",0
3065," ...more than competent and less than inspired, [Almost Human] should find a nontheatrical niche among genre fans.",1
76877," One of the most exhilarating, barmy and eye-wateringly gorgeous movies of the decade.",1
100133," We are left wondering why, in any case, an imitation Sirk was needed, what appetite or interest it might fill. Even with its latter-day (modified) frankness, Far From Heaven is only thin glamour that lacks a tacit wry base.",0
214302," A gripping thriller, this deserves to cross over from the subtitled bracket into mainstream cinema.",1
209236," An enjoyable teen rom-thriller that never swerves off the beaten path but always keeps its footing. Expect a franchise, and career boosts for Pettyfer and Agron.",1

61820," ""It would take a week mucking out a pork pie factory to acclimatise for a hamfest as nauseating as this.""",0
74245," Most of it is pretty predictable, familiar stuff. But Dwayne Johnson has a presence whose sum is more than the total of his acting parts.",0
160289," The movie walks a thin blue line between creating bad guys who are so tough you can't help but like them, and making them so vicious that there's little to admire.",1
227643, Passably speedy on the level of other TV retreads that seem miscast on the big screen.,0
20455," Trapero's film shares some of the eerie economical horror of Mexico's 2011 film ""We Are What We Are"", but his is more horrifying given the looming shadow of Argentina's recent history and the utterly corrupt evil which Francella conjures.",1
132129," All We Had focuses on the mother-daughter relationship, but lacks any sort of long-term direction or finality.",0
19653," Godzilla roars back to life in this new Toho Production, but the filmmakers' attempts to teach the old monster some new tricks only partially succeed.",1
55302," The stuttering, episodic pace makes you wonder if they had half a mind on a miniseries. Where the other half went is really anyone's guess.",0
98719," A Hallmark movie would have at least given the female lead something of a personality and plot arc; this movie's all about the celebrity and his emotional journey, while the woman stands around like a prize waiting to be won, the Blessed Hometown Honey.",0

249182, I was deeply impressed by Strangerland and likely for many of the reasons that others have not.,1
117986," Although it starts slowly, there are plenty of rewards in this well crafted family fantasy adventure, as it explores a world in which light bulbs form the sky and a powerful generator acts as its heartbeat.",1
30451," I'm bewildered and frightened to find myself reporting that it's a very good movie, and it might have been a wonderful one.",1
44914," Both Tragedy Girls, and its fiendishly loveable starring duo, happily join the pantheon of teen movie greats; a genuine cult hit in the making.",1
133346, There's not that much to get excited about here as this is essentially a CBS Sunday Night Movie featuring one of the biggest stars on the planet.,0
200747," With his hands on the pulse of blue-collar people, Richard Linklater leads the film to satisfying conclusions and brings the best out in the cast.",1
251555, The high concept breeds lowbrow gags.,0
192919," By hook or by crook, Williams chivvies everyone along to the requisite throat-clearing denouement. A feelgood finale, for sure. You just might feel like you've been man-handled to get there.",1
63598," New Year's Eve is a perfect example of why the adjective ""Hollywood"" is so often used as a pejorative.",0
121817," An enticing, brilliantly scripted film about the movie industry and how the deals are made.",1
34960, A literary love story that's rooted in repression.,1
176916, The Man Who Invented Christmas is the very definition of festive fun for the entire family. It is an instant holiday classic and one that celebrates creativity and imagination.,1
228334," The moves are telegraphed way in advance, like idiots playing chess, but you always get your money from the play set",1
21809," Miami Vice is a dark, grainy and heavy drama and so super-serious and smoky thick it could be called Miasma Vice.",0
44218," A document that, much like the denial-stricken members of the Friedman clan, seems to have become so clouded by bias that it refuses to look for the truths in front of it.",0
103732, The Overnighters isn't just a movie about the economic crisis or the breakdown of the American Dream. Its powerful metaphors take it from very specific circumstances to something universal. ,1
179849," Taken as a lively adventure yarn, it's enjoyable, but the claims that there's more to it than that ring a little hollow.",1
149994," He's brutal and vulgar, but he fills the film",0
107525, The problem comes when we realize it's a Tommy Lee Jones film and the title is more than just a random coincidence. It's a really good film that was almost great.,1
145013," The core story is relatively simple, but its child's-eye depiction of a toddler's existential angst is inventively rendered with surreal flights of fancy that fall somewhere between Where the Wild Things Are, Inside Out and A Christmas Carol.",1
119068," There's value in films about supernatural heroes and bigger-than-life villains, but the ones that stick with us feature characters we can relate to. Apatow has given birth to that sort of film, and he should be a very proud papa.",1
247419, This is exactly the kind of reboot that the franchise desperately needed... a massive and incredibly enjoyable step in the right direction.,1
44396, This is what happens when faerie tales are taken for the explorations of the human game that they truly are.,1

155380, You either buy into this premise or you don't and I'm sorry to say I found Rocky utterly preposterous.,0
119814, Leguizamo and Swayze - and especially Snipes - just seem like Hollywood stars putting on a cabaret show. There is never any sense that these guys are real people.,0
215358, Tim Burton's mind is as peculiar as can be and usually that works. This time it doesn't. He packs this movie with superb effects but in the end it's Harry Potter light. ,0
234901," The Seventh Dwarf's female characters are deplorably retrograde on both the script and design levels; they have little to do except be rescued, and Snow White is a vain, buxom sexpot whom the dwarfs leer at.",0

20898," Battle of the Sexes is a fun biopic, albeit one that will likely leave you wishing you'd watched a documentary on the subject for more specific insights into these interesting characters. ",1
26446," Just when you think (Mamet) can't plow more storylines into his situations, the slightly bloated script finds room for five or six more.",1
199405," It fools you at the outset into thinking you're going to be seeing another pulpy spy thriller, and then presents you with strangely feasible scenarios that ... make you fear for the real world you're living in.",1
110422," If it wasn't lame enough already, they throw in a mid-film recap for the plot-impaired... we want to know which studio executive's family was held hostage until he green-lighted this movie.",0
206025, ...[a] refreshingly jubilant spin on filmmaker Waters' classic tongue-in-cheek tune-maker Hairspray...spirited pizzazz and a peppy ode to retro-artistic sentimentality,1
110447," ""The Choice"" is the 11th feature film to be adapted from a novel by bestselling author Nicholas Sparks. They should have stopped at No. 10.",0
222761, Shyamalan has shown himself to be an outstanding master of atmosphere and a riveting storyteller.,1

59874, Match Point is Woody Allen's best picture in more than a decade -- an excellent character piece/social study that evolves into a suspense thriller with an O. Henry twist.,1
230665," What happened to James Bond?? I honestly wanted to be a ""Dancing Queen"" and dance right out of the theatre. Mamma Mia! is one of the most awkward, poorly acted and just laughably bad musicals to date.",0
144728," Welcome to the freak show. ""The Devil Inside"" has everything you would expect from an R-rated horror movie about demon possession: creepy demon voices, contorted bodies, bloody murders and priests who actually think they have a chance of defeating Satan.",0
15818, Director/co-writer Joe Penna draws out an honest performance from actor Mads Mikkelsen and uses the quietest moments to allow moviegoers to feel the pain and exhaustion the film's protagonist is experiencing.,1
117833, MFKZ is the kind of barely-there fantasy that disappears from your memory even while you're watching it.,0

172092, One of the year's most emotionally affecting movies.,1
223433," ...reading this as a Cold War allegory is doing the movie a very big favor. In reality, this is a film about tentacles and teeth and eyes and orifices and goo, goo, goo.",0

184753," True Grit isn't so much a major film as a good time, and there's nothing wrong with that. Maybe this movie can get westerns back in the saddle again.",1

107490, The movie annoyed me on many levels.,0
1516," As both a racing movie and a video game adaptation, this is a missed opportunity.",0
123948, This is a movie for movie theaters. This is a film that cannot be appreciated to its full extent off of the big screen. Gravity is why movie theaters exist.,1

117568," Jeanne was particularly taken with the fact that females dominate the males, making all the key decisions in their island exploration. She could hardly contain her glee at our screening. ",1
124584," Robbie is impressive, but Allison Janney steals the movie as Harding's endlessly bitter and bullying mother.",1
70739," There's rapport between Steve Carell and Paul Rudd, well cast as the Odd Couple, but the source material (French farce), which was nastier in dissecting manners and mores, has been softened and the comedy is not funny enough.",0

143604," A captivating, wickedly funny and provocative satire with a breakthrough performance by Rich Sommer. ",1
88932," Hungarian animator Marcell Jankovics adapts Imre Madach's 1861 poem for a pessimistic epic on existence. This illustrated theology lectures: after the Fall, no one is free.",1
189307," Evil Dead is a better film than was probably expected, but as good as the effects and bloodwork are here -- and they are jaw-droppingly fantastic -- they don't make up for the film's incredibly shoddy and flaccid script.",1
30661," Though touted as 'traditional' animation, a good chunk of the film is computer-crafted. It's jarring to see the distinctly different styles clash in the same scenes.",0
250461," It's still basically a boxing picture, not essentially different from dozens of other movies about life in and around what the old time sportswriters used to call 'the squared circle'. Mamet's circle is, alas, just a little too square.",0
202239," This is, perhaps, [Charlize Theron's] best performance. [Full review in Spanish]",1

127062, so gossamer thin that it's hard to feel strongly about it one way or the other,0
36004, I was inspired as much by the movie's egghead take on science ficiton as the bravura performance from Sam Rockwell at the center.,1

99035, Much of the comedy left me cold.,0
153298," This hangout flick doesn't just embrace gross-out girl comedy cliches, it sticks Jacobs in the air roof of a limousine screaming, ""Whooo! I am a total cliché right now and I don't f-king care!""",1

227302," All the Money in the World is a quality film. Director Ridley Scott brings his talents to bear on this story and tells it in a compelling dynamic way, capturing the tone of the times in a visually engaging fashion. ",1
141970," The Disappearance of Alice Creed is a timely reminder that you can make a terrific film with only three characters, a two-bedroom flat (well, mostly) and a bit of imagination.",1
21082," Grimaces its way through 85 long, low-key minutes just to marvel again and again that, gosh, mommies really love their babies.",0

134557," Relative unknown Joey King, as Ramona, is on the right side of precocious, using her adorableness in carefully measured doses. She easily carries the movie.",1

214445, [Director Alexander] Payne [is] wrestling with big ideas about climate change and human rights. Those big ideas just don't always fit comfortably in a small package.,0
122030, Disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances.,0
186420, That old idiom about truth being stranger than fiction is an understatement when applied to Bart Layton's enthralling documentary.,1
48237," As screwball comedy, the film is entirely too restrained, coasting for too long on recycled gags.",1
164933, A languid slow-burner that builds into a bleak portrait of a troubled teen.,1
84585," It's a stunner. Unlike many other romantic comedies of recent years, it's actually funny and actually romantic -- heartbreakingly so, since there's no ""happily ever after"" part. ",1
12114," I was immensely moved by ""Red Dog"", and I can't picture a movie-goer who won't be. It's wonderful.",1
231181," Gloriously daft but with a good deal of heart, Fanged Up's Hammer in the slammer shtick has a surprising amount of bite. It's great entertainment for a night in with good friends and a couple of crates of beer -- unless, of course, you only drink wine.",1

67213, One of the worst movies that has ever been conceived. I loathed and despised absolutely every pathetic second of it.,0
83449," There's a lot less time available to get high than just laying low, for this chemically disoriented pair. Pineapple Express, a mixed bag of assorted fruits and nuts, with doper loons on the lam waiting to inhale.",0
186558," Well-cast with dazzling visuals and production design, but somewhat dull, and it lacks enough surprises and wit to escape its mediocrity. It's lucky to have Benedict Cumberbatch who rises above the material with his charisma.",1
228116," The problem with Skiptrace is that it seems as a labored and redundant rag-tag vehicle trying to bask in the shadowy spirit of Chan's typical big screen, high-wire Hong Kong police procedurals from yesteryear.",0
60121, The gender role-playing puts spine in this period piece that is vital to the here and now.,1
190078," If this film were as racist as it is sexist (which it very nearly is), it would be a buddy movie about the madcap antics of two Klan members on a lynching spree. Appalling. If we could give it zero out of five, we would.",0

178455," ...an amalgamation of ""Romancing the Stone"" (writer leaves safe life to experience adventure), ""Cloak & Dagger"" (same actor portrays father and literary hero) and ""Home Alone"" (kid fends off adult home invaders).",1
228734," The movie feels like a reductive exercise. Rodriguez might have accomplished what he set out to do, but I'm not sure he's done anyone any favors.",0
226906, Writer/director Cochran is stronger on capturing the texture surrounding her characters' converging experiences than making much of it when they do get together.,1
182317, It's funny and poignant and not for the easily offended.,1
100778," At its core, ""The Company You Keep"" is a good, solid thriller about a fugitive trying to clear his name. But it's a much more interesting movie at the edges.",1

212339," ... a solid, smart adult entry into the summer sweepstakes this year, and a nice moment for Mann, even if it doesn't particularly break new ground.",1
241244, The Big Bounce is great entertainment if you enjoy watching Morgan Freeman play dominoes.,0
179896, The real key to the film is the commanding Michael Shannon.,1
224939," This fourth chapter comes off as the first fully postmodern Alien film: not Alien multiplied or cubed, but synthetically reawakened, groggy enough to sleepwalk through our memories of the first three, as in a dream.",1
196188, The humour is British - low key but often barbed - and the filmmakers manage to control the tone of the film through the many elements of the human experience from love and art to death and broken relationships. ,1
176642," Unless the sight of Stewart kissing Pattinson (and, later, Lautner) is enough to send you into convulsions of joy, there aren't any thrills or surprises in this movie.",0
23724," The film is stuck in the inconsequential rut of the series. The characters are static, and the comedy is situational rather than dramatic.",0

108140, There is simply no way to make a >i>Death Wish-retread like Death Sentence believable.,0
219422, Wow. I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time.,0
84279," Bates plays with horror tropes, juggling black comedy and suspense in scenes that tease a gory release but ultimately only emphasize how much members of the creative class can underestimate their backward kin.",0
73450," Even when it seems the story may be winding up, new and fascinating facets of this narrative jewel are revealed, giving the audience a one-sitting feast, which still has its place in our rich media diets.",1
141663, The film is sufficiently smart and engaging that Abrams has effectively guaranteed the characters will be back for further adventures.,1
49461," Gets a lot of mileage from its specialty, which happens to be the close call.",1
87854, Wheatley's sui generis sophomore effort confirms him as a weasel to watch under the cocktail cabinet for.,1
110729, The result is an entertaining film but not a very substantial one.,0
187222, Green Room is one of those rare horror movies that actually gets better rather than worse as it proceeds.,1
244462, Yeah...um...no...don't ever do this again please. ,0
80706," There's no denying its visceral punch, delivered convincingly with unsteady, hand-held camerawork and profanity-spewing dialogue that makes The Thick Of It sound like Yes Minister. It'll leave you breathless alright.",1
51535, To describe this as a movie about a mediocre businessman biding his time before an appointment probably makes it sound more exciting than it is.,0
228262," The clash of compromised heroes and a cocky, cool-headed criminal mastermind, is clever without being dramatically resonant and more engineered than written. But the direction is a master class in action movie filmmaking.",1
137938, Zathura may be one of those rare cases of a sequel being better than the original.,1
29643," Lemmons' focus on strong female characters, and her willingness to ignore accepted notions of ""black filmmaking"" are powerful assets, but one can't help wishing the film as a whole lived up to its initial promise.",0
4539," Perhaps the movie's final, lasting image embraces all we know: From the mud grows the lotus.",1
139496," De Heer's slow narrative defies traditional arcing, the rewarding if occasionally directionless sense of realism enhanced by his naturalistic camerawork.",1
196026," Director Burger keeps the story flowing nicely, hitting all of the right emotional notes. A fine way to enter the new year!",1
188859," A sweet, kooky doco-drama that has plenty of heart, albeit a paper one.",1
117633," I am not going to deny The Hangover Part II follows the same blueprint as the first film, but, to be honest, it didn't bother me one bit. The reason? I was too busy laughing to care.",1

237895," A long, tedious, preposterous, incoherent video game made for shallow and indolent people. A lackluster blockbuster.",0
126877, It doesn't help that Jennifer Jones' accent and the skin tone of her native make-up fluctuate from scene to scene - she is strictly a force of camp that smacks every awful stereotype with a vengeance.,0
210174," This psychological horror thriller is certainly dourly realistic. It is also very slow going. Yet it generates surprising sympathy for its sociopathic protagonist [and] makes some shrewd points about pain, loss and urban violence.",1
3621, It did everything that I think it intended. It's one of Emily Blunt's best performances. She can do anything.,1
174215," The producers were smart to cast Radcliffe, who's always had the air of a martyr. But Radcliffe wasn't smart to tell the producers yes. ",0
241341," Beginning as a Lenny Bruce routine, Trainwreck ends up as a Harlequin Romance.",1
48103," While operating as an intrigue, La fille inconnue is standard Dardenne fare in that it doubles as a social survey, revealing the concerns and living conditions of Jenny's various patients.",1
3001, A quietly melancholic study of a father-daughter relationship playing out under the shadow of her terminal disease.,0
239689, A cut above its pretentious predecessors; the graphic set-pieces -- including an opening inspired by Poe's 'The Pit and the Pendulum' -- deliver the gory goods.,1
99676," [A] feeling of oppressive sadness, of colossal waste on the battlefields of France and the Low Countries, lifts ""Testament of Youth"" above the ranks of generically touching war movies.",1
8384," De Palma has a choppy, episodic sense of story, and he crafts individual scenes rather than telling a single unified story.",0
68250," If you're 14 or younger in age or sensibility, you may giggle at some of the bons mots.",0
111410, You know a movie is slow when the only excitement and the most action is found in an out-of-place and overly long sex scene. ,0
104237," Singer's absence is felt but not fatal. By adding too much new blood Ratner loses some of the original DNA, but with its nifty set-pieces and a few nasty surprises, X3's still a worthy enough sequel to ensure it's no Last Stand.",1

80178," Whereas monkeys and farts will always be funny, Scary Movie sequels shall no longer be so.",0
89963," Because it mirrors Die Hard instead of desperately trying to one-up the first masterpiece, it succeeds as being the most entertaining Die Hard sequel we've seen in years.",1

57976, A whimsical plop of meringue set in 1969 Paris.,0
238225," Denuded of Swift's deadly satire, it has become a dull vehicle for Jack Black to mug and frolic and generally find a million ways to not be entertaining",0
205264," Indeed, there's nothing deep about this latest thriller featuring a stranded person facing the elements at sea.",0
192689," Thanks to a razor-sharp performance by Reese Witherspoon, this movie produces a lot more entertainment than its paper-thin premise deserves.",1
55374, St. Bernard Syndicate is an adequate film for what it is.,1
18869," Despite all of its well-intentioned, high-minded aspirations, Strangerland is a hodgepodge that plods along at a torpid pace.",0

11379," Had Wang's movie been a little less impressed with its own world-weariness, a little less intent on trying to reshape Last Tango in Paris (or, perhaps, 9 1/2 Weeks) for the age of the Internet, he might have been on to something.",0
194191, Delivery Man has charm to spare.,1

229648, accessible to the mainstream and expertly done from a technical level,1
71859," Only a limited number of things can happen in this kind of movie, of course, but Saulnier manages pace, tone and storytelling so adroitly that you won't quite expect any of them to happen when they do, or even how.",1
51618," Dark Star gives us the world of H.R. Giger at its most intimate, yet fails to make use of the access to ask any questions or gain any insight to the late, groundbreaking artist. Giger is an enigma that this film seems determined to remain an enigma",0
153866," The Boys Are Back is based on a true story, and not in a good way. It's obviously true; otherwise why would anyone think it's worth telling a story so trivial?",0
230989, Takes one of mankind's key tales of grace and redemption and reduces it to horror.,0

45071," Full of sex, drugs, catfights, violence, hallucinations and even some choice girl-on-girl action. What more could you possibly want from a ballet movie?",1

237662," Why doesn't Wendy Vanden Heuvel do more film? As Clair's cranky cousin Alice, she does more acting with a smirk and a turtleneck than the rest of the cast combined.",0
83948, It's a mess - a Spielbergian heartwarmer that's also an action movie that's also an activist screed that takes on not only capitalism but also animal rights. But that it doesn't all go together is part of the charm.,1

101895," Rich in emotional honesty and equal parts funny/moving, The Big Sick successfully infuses the traditional rom-com formula with a modern sensibility.",1
166836, The movie is a more objective opportunity to assess Lautner's potential as a general-purpose action hero once his emo-goth run wraps. You might not want to go betting on that one.,0
145069, The film has a dark symmetry and dangerous moments that prove to be as funny as its sunnier ones.,1
229643," The action is savage and seemingly unending. There are many ""did you see THAT?"" moments that will keep you talking afterwards and perhaps bring you back for a second viewing.",1

58298, Has just enough astringent touches to keep it from sliding into sloppy sentimentality.,1
242516," Poppe's intimate story feels contrived. Autobiographical films have a tendency to come off that way, likely because the director lacks distance and takes plot and character development for granted.",0
217510," Leisurely, yet competitive, culinary tour de farce",1
116358," It's basically just Annie Hall set in the 1930s, but he's remade Annie Hall like nineteen times and no one has cared yet, so I don't see why anyone will care now.",0
196918," Numbingly dull when it isn't unintentionally laugh-out-loud funny, this pitiful sequel has almost none of the cheesy/sleazy appeal of the 1992 blockbuster. Michael Douglas stayed away, and so should you.",0

107514," A droll, amusing cautionary tale about the chances of living ""happily ever after"" - and wait for the zany outtakes during the final credits.",1
224968," This is far from a traditional murder mystery. The richness of the characterisations and depiction of the essence of who all the characters are, is one of the film's greatest strengths. Performances are utterly convincing",1
159499, An average movie blessed with an amazing performance. ,1
129480," Keaton is earnest, sentimental, a little goofy. But the flibbertigibbet routine is getting tired. Meanwhile, Douglas chews the scenery as a modern-day Ebenezer Scrooge. The movie is bland at best, more often boring (and, at times, offensive). ",0
14670, Hero soars on the tragic lyricism and poetic passion of Zhang's vision and the heartfelt performances of his cast.,1
100792," It might be intended to spread holiday cheer, but this misguided ensemble comedy has just the opposite effect.",0
245851," Unfortunately, Ari Libsker's hour-plus docu on this potentially mind-boggling topic meanders disconnectedly, as various experts, collectors and storytellers kick around anecdotes and theories that tend to cancel each other out.",0

166396," It's refreshing in this summer of supersized, city-destroying mayhem to see a smaller, personal superhero story.",1
226789," As a children's film, it's a bore. And as a grand film enterprise, Where the Wild Things Are skirts the line between folly and fiasco.",0
22728," With weak performances, forced VFX and a badly structured script, Tera Intezaar is a film where you will be waiting desperately for the end credits to roll. To say it's a long wait for that is no understatement.",0
71471," One confused picture, endeavoring to find pockets of dramatic depth as it organizes a big screen bloodbath.",0
145626," As I said, I know most people don't like this flick, but I think it is worth at least catching the matinee.",0

96062," Destined to be the family hit of the Christmas season, Frozen has all the elements to make it an outright winner",1
112216, Director Zack Snyder and his production crew clearly had great fun envisioning this swords-and-corsets fantasy. Few others are likely to approach their level of enjoyment.,0

56501," Extends and deepens the 1982 original sci-fi noir, expanding on the apocalyptic cyberpunk vision and further exploring fundamental questions about what defines humanity.",1
50306," A omething of a disappointment. The initially fascinating, ambiguous relationship between the two young women is overwhelmed by the hysteria spawned by her unflaggingly intense presence at the monastery",0
152474," Wild though the film often is, a truly revelatory history of the studio and its legacy remains untold.",0
228100, 70s-savant writer/director Ti West has come up with a satanic-panic stroke of genius with The House of the Devil.,1
61058," The parts of ""Isle of Dogs"" with the dogs are so wonderful that I still recommend the film. I just wish he had taken as much care and attention with his human puppets.",1
95851," Appropriate Behaviour has an indulgent, slightly precious autobiographical feel - but it is funny, risky and in exhilaratingly bad taste.",1
166357," Thin on plot, it recycles fascinating character scenarios multiple times, hoping the chemistry of the actors will carry the day. ",1
180591, Not short on dewy depictions of animal relationships and the healing powers of pooch presence. What's added here is a layer of darkness that's unexpected.,1
98544," A movie-movie, with edgy cred and a vivid dystopian vision that, while ostensibly futuristic, speaks harshly to the class divide already defining us.",1
86659," Here it is: with grotesque and repugnant tastes, the worst movie of 1980.",0
111845, succeeds brilliantly with a visually dynamic component that is nothing less than dazzling,1
17141, The most unfortunate thing about Jawbreaker has to be its blatant imitation of 1989's vastly superior Heathers.,0

125707," 'Warrior' makes you cheer, sweat, laugh and in a completely shocking twist, cry just a little bit.",1
162075, A splendid reinvention of the 1957 movie alternating vivid gunfights against a gorgeous background with brain-games of the most manipulative sort.,1
145290," Sneakily, the best science-fiction film of the summer.",1
77577," Locke is a terrific little film; despite its closed-in setting, it never feels overtheatrical or contrived...the perfect blend of setting and performance.",1
3479," Between the moralizing life lessons that are spouted at full volume intensity, the film doesn't shy away from graphic, bloody violence.",0
169351," Tag is a crass, dumb, typical summer comedy that delivers in the end.",1
152736, Dead Man Down is a very serious thriller featuring very serious stars being very serious about the seriousness at hand.,0
104473, FIRST MAN does a first-rate job of re-creating the unbearable tension and excitement of the first landing on the moon.,1
101636," The result is a truly engrossing film, one of the year's best nonfiction portraits of the natural world.",1
152021," In adapting Winifred Watson's 1938 novel, director Bharat Nalluri strains frantically to evoke the champagne fizz of classic screwball comedies.",0
103879, A plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists.,0
213693," A same-old story of a white man's angst, set against the 'exotic' backdrop of 1980s war-torn Beirut. This brand of Hollywood myopia is tired, uninteresting, and no longer acceptable.",0
126752," What we find out about Maier, revealed in self-portraits as a striking woman with a singular sense of self, is fascinating.",1
158536," This entertaining new comedy from Nora Ephron, about famed chef Julia Child and author Julie Powell, is a homage to every woman's unique talent for reinvention.",1
174256," Once the special effects take over, Berg has little room to assert his personality (or tell a story, for that matter), and the movie feels like a chore.",0
69623, Its underwritten characters and hoary approach plunk it into mediocrity.,0
58982, Few movies about groups of male friends do such a strong job with the dynamics between individual people and the collection as a whole.,1
70755," Dark, campy melodrama with focus on sex and drugs.",0
14876, A talky and understated head game.,1
216315," The Woman in Black is not the best ghost story ever made, but it is one of the purest and most effective to hit cinemas in quite a long time. That in itself makes this a film worth cherishing, goose bumps and all.",1
140960," POTC: At World's End clocks in at more than 2 3/4 hours, but, unlike last year's bloated sequel, at least possesses some semblance of a destination, making it slightly more coherent -- if no less numbing during the protracted finale.",1
71412," Dramatically flat and frankly monotonous. On the plus side, Carell and Chalamet give fearless performances.",1
130486," If you name your movie after the titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from the Gods and shared it with mankind, you'd better cast a lot of light. Prometheus leaves us in the dark.",0

130471, Lifted above the average by a pretty nifty twist and some unnecessarily good acting.,1
71226, The film spends too much time trying to be as meaningful with its comedy as it is raunchy.,0
221987," The screwball comedy's charm verges on frothy wish fulfillment, but gets anchored by Amy Adams' refusal to play shallow",1
251890," Despite any titular trepidation, there is fun to be had and even some cultural relevancy if you decide to say hi to The Bye Bye Man.",1
199255, The experience becomes unnervingly intoxicating.,1
145624, Nobody would know what Sylvester Stallone fans want from a Stallone action movie better than Sly himself.,1
227837," And yet the film remains strangely watchable, even when it's gone bonkers. Especially when it's gone bonkers.",0
185979," ... more concerned with the psychology of horror than the blood and guts, as the film preys on common fears and paranoia without turning manipulative or sacrificing tension.",1
73783," Solace turns 007 into a bore. Even worse, he's a bore with once killer moves that are impossible to appreciate viewed through Forster's distorted touch.",0
80408, Succeeds because it focuses on a lost art of cinema: Character development.,1
161054," Whatever interest Vox Lux earns peters away by the tiresome climax. Style never trumps substance, no matter how earnest the delivery.",0
129501," Captivating, thought-provoking.",1
210420," Jason DeVan's exorcism tale is proficient enough technically, but toothless and tedious.",0
227749," An emotionally empty, thematically ill-defined, and listless affair. It is never able to communicate the complexity of the woman at its center.",0
234081," The threadbare, uninteresting plot could be overlooked were it not for the lifelessness surrounding it. The filmmakers mix tones and eras without purpose or effect. The appealing Roberts struggles to carry the burden. Wholesomeness shouldn't be so hard.",0
216533, Coppola wants to chastise a tabloid culture where almost anybody can become an instant celebrity...but it's an easy target and when spun through a group of barely sketched characters...it makes The Bling Ring a weightless experience...,0
232629," It directly confronts the misogyny and chauvinism of contemporary Afghanistan, while powerfully suggesting that storytelling is both a means of coping and a solution for change.",1
184567," Overall feels uneven, sprawling and strangely incomplete.",0
183993," There's escapism, and then there's promoting vanity, self-interest and idleness like they're enviable lifestyle choices.",0
90732," Where Hannaford crashes and burns, Welles succeeds with brilliance, adding to the sense of tragedy surrounding the film. It should have come out in its time. ",1
111236, Wisely banks on the inherent cool factor of Murray's presence to keep it from completely being subsumed by the treacle pit of sentiment it perilously navigates. ,1
98986," Rudnick specializes in hurling poison darts. Here he throws armloads of them, and a surprising number hit the board.",1
99211," Even as ""Interstellar"" becomes a beautiful mess, its wannabe-deep impact will hit everyone differently. We need far-reaching artists like Nolan, since, as they say, Earth without art is ""eh.""",1
170992," More originality, or at least a better navigation of these well-worn tropes, would have improved this immensely.",0
76," Its restrained aesthetic and Driver's sublime, understated performance render it the director's most recognizably human and poignant film.",1
4343," A medieval comedy that will only appeal to those with a taste for silly accents, anachronistic cursing and jokes about masturbation.",0
133400," Ballet is all about making the body achieve amazing feats seemingly effortlessly, and the animation replicates that with often sublime effect.",1
180696," Between longing stares and the most incestually erotic peach pie baking ever seen, we get what amounts to a Lifetime TV movie with bigger stars and a better production value.",0
52475," Trimmed down and focused on its core, this would be another notch in Apatow's belt; as it is, ""This Is 40"" is about 40 minutes too long.",0
152874, There is a richness of character here that belies the film's trim eighty-six minute running time.,1
14302," Yes, Million Dollar Baby is about the grit and glory of boxing. It's about the count, the bell and the gloves in the air, but also about the human heart and all the tenderness and strength it can muster. And in both corners, it's a knockout.",1
197113," For the most part, the script is extremely well written, allowing each character to shine and developing some interesting ideas. It is also, frequently, very funny.",1
12116," Many scenes seem designed to illustrate platitudes, at the expense of the narrative.",0
204243," Sandi Tan's view of what the original Shirkers represented, and what her new film should be, proves surprisingly expansive.",1
1137," Even with a great cast and a great story idea, the movie fails to build even a hint of suspense.",0
152535," An immense achievement founded on the enduring themes of loyalty, destiny, and hope.",1
244871, Gibney plays up the thriller elements of his story.,1
219269," The script, performances, and overall look combine to make for an engrossing, suspenseful drama that goes a little beyond the bounds of its science fiction genre.",1
201636, Too often she substitutes petulance for the curiosity and determination the role requires.,0
180791, Just because the film starts taking itself seriously doesn't mean you have to.,0
201250," It's not very funny. Like everything in the third Ocean's movie, these scenes have a great set-up and no payoff. The casual charm that was displayed so easily in Ocean's Eleven has turned downright lackadaisical.",0
17299, It is over. You say nothing is over until we say it is over? The long national nightmare ends not with a bang or a thud but with one of the biggest FUs in Cinematic history,0
59820," Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady evoke the human heart of the economic malaise that's eating away at the core of this country, while pointing the way toward better days ahead.",1
92882," One of the most dour, dank and despairing of all film noir offerings.",1
92513, Tarantino brings a very bold political film disguised as a western that seems deep but at the same time can be enjoyed without any problems. [Full review in Spanish],1
84493," Rendition's heart is in the right place, but feels like a desperate single attempt to get it all out at once out of fear of losing another chance. I am glad I saw it, but I don't ever need to see it again.",1
178204," This odd combination of 'Moulin Rouge' and 'March of the Penguins' also functions as a weirdly scary 'first contact' science-fiction story with an earned eco-message, linking it to Miller's breakthrough movies, 'Mad Max' and 'The Road Warrior.'",1
244169," Melinda returns Woody Allen to more steady ground; yet, his film still feels like a work completed with one eye closed.",0
26829," The film looks with pleasure, but doesn't fulfill expectations with the darkest moments of his life. [Full Review in Spanish]",0
184888," Somers Town is Meadows' first venture outside his East Midlands stamping-ground. It has its lyrical moments, but I watched most of it through splayed fingers.",0
97765," Weirdly entertaining and fun, yet well below the genre's high standard of now days. [Full review in Spanish]",0
146151, The movie plays quite well for a while but begins to run out of steam in its second half.,0
209597," This 1978 labour of love, one of the most immaculately filmed rock concerts, preserves for posterity the final appearance of the Band, the great group led by Robbie Robertson that had been on the road (often with Bob Dylan) for 16 years.",1
131992," As Shakespeare would have certainly written if he'd been on the movie beat, ""Double, double toil and trouble, movie stink and critic bubble/'Hocus Pocus' has no focus/has no rhyme, has no reason/ and is... out of season.""",0
127736," Actually, the funniest parts of the movie are excerpts from the film that Cameron is originally nominated for.",0
70917," For sheer shock value - and that's really why people go and see a film like this - Bruno delivers. It's clear, however, that the formula is wearing thin, and Baron Cohen need dig deeper into his bag of tricks for his next outing.",1
38826, This is the first of his cartoons to work better as a movie than as a fashion spread.,1
36578," The cast is uniformly good, especially Efron and Bentley as collaborators on the dance floor but rivals in the bedroom.",1
101806," This is the time of year when sentimentality can be a warming thing, and Parton's Coat will keep an awful lot of people warm this winter.",1
55199," This film proves that the Swedes can really do funny and not just dark, dour and disturbing.",1
125171," That the film, directed in swift strokes by F. Gary Gray from a screenplay credited to Kurt Wimmer, doesn't really work -- unrelentingly grim, unintentionally funny -- is almost beside the point. It's a wild concept.",0
140606, Meet the Browns is saddled with the usual quotient of phony snafus and entanglements that are easily untangled.,0
71199," ...a fairly substantial misfire that pales in comparison to, especially, 2013's Elysium.",0
39372," Entourage simply cannot sustain its storyline or its characters within a cinematic framework...At best you can think of this as an epilogue to the show, a ""very special episode"" where we get to spend some time with characters you've grown to know",0
189324," Palka has an eye for authenticity -- the bland LA apartments, growling traffic and isolation of living in a city that requires people to make their own happiness.",0
107599," The vintage teen-scream thrills, once so fresh, now seem stale.",0
32075," Feels like TV sketches, with not enough laughs.",0

8818," With Donald Trump the President-elect of the United States, The Founder acquires new and tragic relevance as a parable for these uncertain times.",1
73362," Blue Jasmine could've been more comedic, but Blanchett's heavy performance really gave this story a new life on its own.",1
185697, The Mechanic is revenge served up well enough to blast the winter blues away.,0
75981," All of these defects, which aren't unusual in movies of modest budget, could be forgiven if Blood and Chocolate were actually scary. But it isn't; not even a little bit. Werewolf devotees, however, may nevertheless feel that it bites.",0
92839," If the film ultimately seems to question Carol's courage, there's at least no doubt about Ida Lupino's own. ",1
203149," Like it or hate it (or both), you have to admire its skill, and the over-the-top virtuosity of Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland.",1
193683, Gemini feels like an homage to L.A. noir films of the past and is more concerned with being a wink and a nudge rather than its own property.,0
141188, I've always said Mulder pulled off comedy better than drama -- Evolution supports this.,1
149403," Realistic without being exploitative, Herzog tells one his best stories and one of the best survival epics ever.",1
56472," Pic relies on nerdy world-weary irony to carry the day, but doesn't convincingly draw its characters.",0
196608, You Were Never Really Here doesn't quite work for me ... but it is certainly worth watching once it hits streaming services for Phoenix's performance alone.,0
241949, An OK Disney animated entry enhanced by nifty 3-D projection.,1
13013," A soulful and buoyant portrait of a poverty stricken Irish family's winning battle to move beyond the wrenching, contradictory, and chaotic emotions of grief into a new life.",1
41038," It's at once familiar and bizarre, overstuffed yet half-baked. And while it boasts impressive individual elements, the overall result remains far from the magic it seeks.",0
138309, The backdrop is snowy and the humour is as cold and thick as a blizzard in Hans Petter Moland's In Order Of Disappearance.,1
80601, Asimov's anthology is an Orwellian cautionary tale (written before the term existed). Alex Proyas' film is a Big Dumb Summer Action Movie starring Will Smith.,0
88895," This film is less an isolated Jackie Kennedy biopic than a dark and conceptual statement on how the American people classifies, experiences and remembers historic tragedies.",1
120054," Underdeveloped, uneven, low-budget B-movie, a muddled crime-thriller that's not worth the price of admission.",0
121056, Wilder's direction is crisp and the lighting and cinematography (by John F. Seitz) have become iconic touchstones.,1
75552," Based on a true story about fortysomething manchildren still playing tag, this bro-bonding comedy is all over the place, but fueled by a terrific cast and a partytime atmosphere that might be just what you're looking for on a hot summer night. ",1
241473," This is a brainy, brawny popcorn pleaser at its best. And one not easily forgotten.",1
190422, A tense film supported by a good cast and that aims to dialogue about the complex contemporary geopolitical situation. [Full review in Spanish],1
72962," Area 51 is everything that's wrong with not only found footage films, but also weak-minded sci-fi thrillers that think crazed talking heads and fuzzy shadows are scary enough.",0
170338, Objectively this film probably ranks with Chinatown and The Maltese Falcon.,1
127454, It's watchable because of the colorful recreation of L.A. in 1949 (thanks to cinematographer Dion Beebe and production designer Mather Ahmad) and its appealing cast...,0
72989," What a faith-based movie should be: Compelling, intelligent and thoughtful. ",1
198310," We are in desperate need of more authentically working class voices on British screens both big and small at the moment, and this portrayal of a mismatched family unit feels like a breath of fresh air as a result.",1
83188," [A]ll of it becomes a harsh reminder that, even though we may learn from the past, we still seem doomed to repeat it.",1
12825," Scott has the good sense not to bring everything to a neat conclusion. After all, this is really the Rileys' movie, and one about rebirth and letting go of demons.",1
226792, I'm not kidding when I tell you I have worked for a reasonable facsimile of each of the 'Horrible Bosses' depicted in this grownups-only movie. ,1
248711, An out-of-work insurance man makes ends meet by turning to armed robbery in this overwrought and preposterous recession-era morality play from editor turned director Saar Klein.,0
21262, Tries screwball and gross-out comedy and fails on both counts.,0
140874," Hawn and Sarandon hit the ground running, and are so funny and goofy that they distract and delight us.",1
115088," There's a charm about this unabashedly Canuck flick, which gets a boost from Jay Baruchel as Lauren's smarmy and hilariously condescending fiancé. The gorgeous shots of the Prairie capital should have Winnipeggers hankering for home, too.",1
225168," The movie is more a situation than a narrative, and it's repetitive and depressing.",1
203934," The movie's basic joke holds that the overbearing, unselfconscious Americans will do anything and say anything (and usually as loudly as possible), while the timorous British are nearly too polite to breathe.",1
125395," Like one of those machines that can inhale a car and spit out a tidy cube of squashed components, ""Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles"" is a near-indigestible lump of clips and quips and snipped opinions.",0
210587," The worst Nicholas Sparks novel turned movie of them all. But I said that about Dear John, The Lucky One, Safe Haven and The Best of Me. This time I really mean it. ",0
109057," The Ward might not bode too well for Carpenter's come back, but he did do good things with what he had to work with (clichéd story and script).",0
15377," Long after you've seen the film, you'll remember the wonderfully nuanced work of the cast, particularly Ms. Hawkins.",1
158300, An exquisite little puzzle-box gem of clinically constructed perversity.,1
223022," You half expect the CSI: New York characters played by Gary Sinise and Mila Karakanedes to show up at the first, second or third crime scenes.",0
10740," Young's bland Valli never really grabs us the way he should. But when Piazza smolders and glowers as Tommy, the group's fiery wild card, we can't take our eyes off of him.",1
95824, John Hawkes is exceptional. Look for him and Helen Hunt in the Oscar mix. ,1
200501," Get Out finds that sweet spot of laughs, chills, and social commentary. It's so flat-out entertaining, you might not even notice how scathing it really is.",1
219634," Embracing a structure that implicitly acknowledges the complexity of the issue, Ms. Marson nevertheless contributes to the film's general fuzziness by failing to clarify the legal and moral guidelines that govern these kinds of prescriptions.",0
33661, A self-congratulatory collection of feeble meta-awareness just dopey enough for adolescents to mistake for clever comedy.,0
124811," Louis Theroux investigates the Church's controversial history through a mixture of interviews, recreations and likeable bumbling.",1
93013," If the book is basically Fifty Shades of Grey for guys who have yet to discover their peckers, the film is a diverting slice of entertainment, offering enough surface thrills to justify its existence in a world already overloading on nostalgic feints.",1
7297," Writer-director Adam Christian Clark's Caroline and Jackie clobbers the viewer with a wall of insistent stylishness, a Ketel One ad that just won't quit, or Bellflower for people whose Blackberry is a vital organ. ",0
200945," Director Adriana Trigiani, adapting her best-selling novel, delivers the hackneyed material with good cheer, eliciting bright performances from an [excellent] ensemble cast.",1
229779," Writer-directors Damon Beesley and Iain Morris manage to expand one hallmark, a gift for the grossest of gross-out, without diminishing the other - an essential sweetness of spirit.",1
147991, A brutally raw documentary about GIs manning an exposed outpost in the world's most dangerous place.,1
217262, The CGI Kong is cool.,1
78398," Style is substance in Ford's second film. Unlike many puzzle-piece movies, it thrills on every level.",1
217924, A wheezy and utterly incompetent attempt to further extend the life of a franchise that was already running on fumes back when Ronald Reagan was still a first-term president. ,0
98052," For all its computer-generated effects and colorful sight gags, Magorium is a dreadfully prosaic movie, lacking charm and grace.",0
21168," It's shocking that for all of the advances in computer generated imagery, they still can't make a realistic looking werewolf. Lon Chaney's original 1941 werewolf far outshines the hairy beast here. ",0
29667," Anyone with a disability or who has variously challenged people in their lives (which is pretty much all of us), will enjoy the feeling of hope that permeates director/writer Daniel Ribeiro's entry into the gay, coming-of-age genre.",1
246241," Despite the provocative title, the film is actually quite sweet, and more importantly; it's [Kevin Smith's] funniest work in years.",1
235542," A deeply depressing mess of a movie whose antic busyness drains at the center, all snap and energy sucked into a howling void where a decent joke used to be.",0
98147, Athletic dancing and a patriotic theme make this movie better than it should be.,0
21937," The film that Hot Fuzz reminded me of most was The Boys In Blue, in which Cannon and Ball played rural bobbies suddenly confronted with a real crime to solve. As you can probably guess, it wasn't much cop. And neither is this.",0
201858," This is a series that went back to what made it work so well... a game that you wouldn't want to play yourself, but you have to know how it ends.",1
121960," The performers are excellent and they score some laughs, but their roles here amount to ""the jealous friend"" and ""the progressive activist.""",0
151208, The jokes are squeezed from the ragged plot with the grace of an arthritic senior citizen trying to get milk out of a coconut by hand.,0
48535," It's not even as scary as his Halloween remake, and that one was perfunctory, at best.",0
191955," It's great to see the typically imposing Mirren portray someone so carefree and flip, while the usually zany Walters successfully plays a calmer, more thoughtful character. ",1
122602," Fox is quite touching here, topped only by Sean Penn in a superb, frightening performance.",1
216485, I'm sorely disappointed.,0
208371," Piddington does a beautiful balancing act, creating a movie that works both on the level of suspense and as a detailed factual chronicle.",1
127836," Remaking Friday is not exactly dabbing a mustache on the Mona Lisa, and if embraced on a lowered scale of expectation and artistic requirement, this new spin on an iffy ""classic"" feels pretty nifty in miniature doses.",1
225196, This year's most unexpected joy. I've watched it three times now and I don't even particularly like Justin Timberlake's music.,1
220129, This story was better off back in the maze.,0
29875, The Christmas movie your parents warned you about -- because they wanted it all for themselves.,1
97971," Hedlund is a gritty revelation, desperate and magnetic. Dean's constant need for sex is understood as a sign of damage, part of the same compulsion that sends him all over America, bouncing between wives.",1
232707, The dourness and grit that Newell opts for stylistically doesn't really carry any weight because Pip always seems too passive - more easily swayed than driven by obsession.,0
227981, Aja creates a very effective slasher thriller only to light a match and send it up in flames with a third act twist that makes absolutely no sense,0
102259, [Hensleigh's] trying to pack in too much and the density clogs the narrative machinery.,0
84315," An annoying one-two-three punch of crappy acting, shoddy scriptwriting, and poor direction.",0
100059," [S]omewhat expectedly, this film doesn't measure up to its predecessor, but still passes for a popcorn action blockbuster.",1
79170, a sweet and savory epistolary romance,1
164031, [W]oefully misbegotten... [T]he CGI animation -- pointlessly rendered in 3D -- is plastic and cheap.,0
50944," One of the better Christmas films to come along in a while, proving that a smart director and capable actors can turn a rote story into a welcome gift.",1
165616," As a testament to the transcendent power of love and faith, it's gorgeous to look at, occasionally erotic, thoroughly confounding and at times ridiculous. ",0
128213, A puzzling affair of murky motivations and leaps of logic that no amount of Meg Ryan skin and no number of faked orgasms can hide.,0
77353," Broadbent is appealing as always, but the movie is too subdued to make full use of his talents.",0
59034," If you like a bloody laugh and you relish the idea of body parts hurtling at you threatening to shower your popcorn with blood, this might be the film for you. Greeted by more guffaws than screams, My Bloody Valentine wears its heart on its pickaxe",0
123147," To an extent, the film plays like a mixtape: slowly unwinding, confident in its own rhythms, unafraid to luxuriate in comic asides or hurtle forward the action.",1
125222, There's very little to enjoy here.,0
7939," Yes, it's sweet and enjoyable, but it's also a bit plodding.",1
90543, A fast-paced yet foolishly fanged fable...,0
87380, When the subject is the specific sound of Elvis's music - the component parts and how they ultimately combine and fuse - The Searcher is an absolute banger,1
28348," Offbeat and off-putting, unless you're really heavily into ""guilt and sins and hell and all that.""",0
194679, Toss in a few secrets revealed and Captain America: Civil War kicks off the summer movie season with a punch strong enough to make the Hulk's head spin.,1
11777," How ironic that Russell Crowe won his Oscar last year for ""Gladiator""",1
228242," Hansel & Gretel, a bizarrely updated twist on the fairy tale, is the perfect example of a movie that is both intentionally and unintentionally funny at the same time.",1
17712, So full of nastiness and cruelty that it's hard to believe anyone would find joy in it.,0
132163," Somewhere around the 20-minute mark, I was convinced that the title was a typo, and they really meant The Perfect Snore.",0
145203," Liza Johnson's nicely tuned, and turned, adaptation of the Alice Munro short story ""Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage.""",1
207419, Young Adult may be the year's meanest studio movie and I mean that as a compliment.,1
32210," It's crass, senseless and, consequently, void of humor.",0
24609, The Messenger's clipped insight that war is hell is just the sort of line straight from the manual that the film strenuously cautions against.,0
27285," Love him or hate him, there's no denying that George W. Bush is a remarkably controversial figure, so how is it possible that Stone has managed to make a movie that's about as incendiary as Kung Fu Panda?",0
65444," Charming, funny, and sentimental, the film is exactly what you expect it to be, but very satisfying in achieving that goal.",1
96763," Logic flies out the window, even given the fantastic elements, and the initially interesting characters are soon reduced to cardboard cutouts. ",0
133480," As much as Thomas transcends her typically reserved, austere presence, it's not quite enough to give the movie the emotional weight it so desperately reaches for.",0
228553," Big Fan shares a nutty kinship with the obsessive-loner pictures of Martin Scorsese, namely Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. And while Oswalt is no De Niro, the stand-up comic brings a schlumpy pathos to his portrait that shows depth and dimension.",1
156788," Slender Man feels as used up as any years-old meme, like trying to explain what's funny about dat boi a decade late.",0
151273," There might be some sort of muddled feminist moral to all this, but by the time the overlong Gothic happenings conclude (with a nicely bloody finale), it's hard to recall what it might have been.",0
142918," I never thought I'd say these words, but here they are: I wish there was more Michael Bay in this movie.",0
201747," ""Father Figures"" completely wastes its comedic cast, especially since it doesn't produce even one hearty laugh.",0
117075," Overwrought, confused, and melodramatic, it reflects well what it's like being 17.",1
174988, The sheer earnestness and unassuming glee of the film manage to pull off what contemporary musicals have been unable to do lately: evoke pure joy and enthrallment. ,1
234448," Hugely entertaining, frequently funny and genuinely moving, this is a sharply written comedy-drama with refreshingly original characters and terrific performances from all five leads.",1
155326," Animation can be a safe place to explore some trickier topics, and Kubo and the Two Strings has a dash of bitter mixed with the sweet.",1
132896," While Book Club is harmless, inoffensive, tame, and often charmingly sweet at times, this thinly written Golden Girls/Sex and the City inspired feature is way too telegraphed.",0
82679," Dee Snyder is charming and the movie is crammed with great archival footage of the band, ranging from their early days as a David Bowie cover act to their jamming onstage with Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead on British TV. ",1
24092," A few horror-story cliches seep in, but with Bello playing a character who is strikingly unglamorous and at times not even sympathetic, Big Driver should deliver for its audience.",1
61142," This film's emotional impact sneaks up on you, but hits home by the end.",1
221605, THE LITTLE HOURS dares to be different in a world of filmmaking that exclaims the only way to be successful is to assimilate.,1
142833," An inspiring - even if sometimes uneven - film, Race addresses topical ideas of racial bigotry by treating them as irrelevant in the grander scheme of things. ",1
33671," Soderbergh keeps the story straightforward and subdued, rather than layering in the action and the drama. At times it even gets a bit dull.",1
167281," There's a quiet power in the mood of loss and loneliness, while the landscape lensing is little short of stunning.",1
118678, [T]he problems arise in the movie's inconsistency with its established rules ... and the invention of more complications than are really necessary.,0
58183," Goes for drippy, excruciating cuteness on the level of teddy bears who tickle you, tuck you in and sing you to sleep.",0
20450," This is a modest film, and an affecting one.",1
70302, One suspects the film-makers have deliberately excluded numbers of a homophobic nature.,0
67971," Starting as a clever Contagion-style investigative thriller, this fiercely paced apocalyptic adventure begins to fall apart early on when smart logic is jettisoned for the more visceral thrills of seeing Brad Pitt save the planet. ",1
241376," After 13 years and two Middle-earth trilogies, Jackson goes out with a bang, a combustible visual mix resembling a violent video game that could use one or two more edit sessions.",0
118335," An honorable failure, but one worth seeing even when it places a little too much importance on being earnest.",1
25414," At times it's hilarious, at times there's so much that you couldn't make up that it's spine-chilling. ",1
178082," The special effects can hardly be classified as special (although a post-production conversion to 3D can take some of the blame). The acting of the young, plummy-talking cast is bland and rough editing of key scenes will leave some viewers puzzled.",0
171000, Writer/Director Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room understands that DIY anarchist punk ethics are in constant danger from a systematic rule.,1
94707, This is slickly made production-line horror that never attempts to do more than merely go through the motions - and not even actors of the calibre of Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick (as Em's mother Stephanie) are able to bring it to life. ,0

64025," An alternate history with humor that is bound to outlast even their latest digs, but still change is difficult and keeping vital remains a constant struggle. By capturing that in such an eloquent way, the film proves to be something else likely to endure.",1
170059," A nerve-jangling, suspenseful, violent, rollicking good time.",1
26227, Marci X proves once again that dumbing down the movie in order to please the lowest common denominator cannot go hand and hand with scathing satire.,0
188890," Any one of these stories, if properly fleshed out and shorn of contrivance, would have made for a perfectly serviceable film. Instead, we have lots of hysterical little bits of nothing much.",0
184440," Overall, The Guard is worth seeing for its actors and some of its smart dialogue, but sometimes it becomes smart-ass past the point of many viewers' enjoyment. ",0
237972," Just the awkward sight of a precocious, overly confident kid with limited natural ability and not enough technical skill being pushed front-and-centre to carry a movie he's not yet ready to carry.",0

176633, The play needs a gritty embrace and gets it. That and a flawlessly chosen cast.,1
148107," The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a Mood Indigo for the masses, a sort of cinematic gateway drug that plays around with art film concepts for audiences who don't necessarily want to watch an art film.",1
77555," Considering the price of movie tickets these days, it's hard to justify recommending this over a Girls Gone Wild video for approximately the same content.",0
82995," There's so much that could have gone wrong with ""Blockers,"" and yet, it defies expectations.",1
100901, The scenes between Bogart and Bacall are so dazzlingly about attraction and sex that they encapsulate the whole magic of movies.,1
15727, ...a disappointingly lifeless adaptation...,0
72292, Jumping is generally worth the leap and not the brush-off.,1
181960," A fairly straightforward and enjoyable movie about an extremely complicated and demoralizing war. Its goal is to focus on a small group of heroes, and it shows little interest in the bigger picture.",1
217645," Taking away the kissing, caressing and a few bloody killings, Friedkin has no story, though picture pretends to be a murder mystery combined with a study of Al Pacino's psychological degradation.",0

121930," More than just a culture-clash comedy, Along the Roadside feels made with care and compassion, and as a bonus has a few surprises up its sleeve.",1
86976," Coming in our moment of recent domestic terror, the movie has a boldness in diving into the whys of political violence.",1
244986, Snowden is Oliver Stone's best work in years. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is sensational in a film that satisfies by humanizing one of the most controversial figures of our times. [Full review in Spanish],1
161319," Basmati Blues isn't nearly as bad as some of the online buzz might indicate...and that's actually unfortunate. Instead of vying for a so-bad-it's-entertaining categorization, it falls squarely into the hell of cinematic mediocrity.",0
176678, It seems almost churlish to suggest that the mysterious storyline is maybe overly woo-woo and precious.,1

1711, Babylon AD is a Blade Runner/Fifth Element wannabe which doesn't have the budget to match its ambitions.,0

217651, The sci-fi action is surprisingly satirical - and surprisingly entertaining.,1
92321," Curse of the Golden Flower, Zhang Yimou's strangest and most troubled film, abounds in hysterical, mannered Tang Dynasty-era palace intrigue and dehumanized CGI battle sequences.",0
700," Prince of Persia is a pleasant-enough diversion that lingers about as long as, well, sand in the wind.",1
83490," A standard, by the numbers romantic comedy.",0
22256," A soap opera of babies, poignant moments, minor crises, and lessons about savouring each day. ",0

251669," Alice Cooper sang the title song, which never hurts, but this movie is beyond saving.",0
23145," As a spoof of the 1970s Bollywood, Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om is well-conceived and executed. As a story about reincarnation, it disappoints.",0
65892, Sometimes you don't want to know what is lurking in the dark because the answer is just too obvious and dumb.,0
216106," They're treading woefully familiar ground with The Back-Up Plan, a movie that could have used one.",0
243430," Regardless of the identical title, ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" isn't some pointless Xerox copy of its '76 predecessor, but a dynamic, atmospherically shot thriller with a perceptive knack for time, place and methodically mounting unease.",1
180415," ""Diana"" isn't just an egregious case of rewriting history, but one of oversimplifying it.",0
45705, 12 Days ends with a lingering shot of a tree-lined street enveloped in thick fog. It's an obvious yet effective metaphor ... for the patients' mental conditions.,1
56160," John Tucker Must Die isn't half bad. It's about two-fifths bad, mostly toward the incoherent ending, but that ratio is... well, not bad.",0
138692," ""American Milkshake"" merrily bumps along as if it were the first movie to find humor in a white kid's idolizing desire to ""be black,"" whatever that may mean to him.",0
158405," ""The craftsmanship on display is finely tuned, the bros know what the hell they're doing, and their story is engaging, even if you can see the twists coming at times.""",1
176367," Because of the birthing story some of this film is fairly interesting. Alas, the last half hour, which is almost totally ridiculous special effects warfare, left me cold.",0
41316," It is [funny], although much of the humor is extraordinarily cheap and obvious.",1
197834, Ralph Fiennes is on great form as violent convict Magwitch and Helena Bonham Carter was born to play deranged jilted bride Miss Havisham.,1
190776," It's not funny, it's not romantic, it's not exciting, it's not for children, it's not remotely interesting.",0
87869," Two long hours of murky photography and slow-motion storytelling, in which the audience is always 10 scenes ahead of the action.",0
176958," If it's a romp, then it's a romp that does what anything on this topic must do: leave audiences a little rattled, with a hint of ashes in the mouth.",1
192602, This awkward hybrid of romantic comedy and ribald girls-just-wanna-have-fun romp is so scattershot that it never earns any of its eventual heartstring tugging.,0

145208," Potty humor, bullying, dark tone in animated dog tale. ",0
105320, No hyper-designed ersatz futurism for Bekmambetov. Night Watch is knowingly frugal and proudly cruddy.,1

192609," A quiet tale, told through a rarely moving camera and a playful, bewitching smile.",1
14227," The Shape of Water is as strange and brave as people can be strange and brave, especially the quiet ones, the weird ones you don't think that much about.",1
192912, It's not a sophisticated view but a reductionist one.,0
87528," Adam McKay has delivered an energetic, highly entertaining movie that could be titled 'The 2008 Credit Bubble Burst for Dummies'. That dummy would be me.",1
198179," This is the story of a culture that allows young people to get lost and the failure of religious institutions to reach them. And of resilience, compassion, and forgiveness. ",1
36805," The LEGO Batman Movie is a hilarious and fun film on its own terms, providing a much-needed satire of the hero after years of taking itself so seriously",1
216838, Fails to engage us in the lives of its characters because it never really introduces them.,0
144503," The very things that make ""Tears of the Sun"" a riveting thriller destroy its attempt to become a powerful drama. Yet, I admire it immensely for its determination to be unique and original.",0
111766, This film is the very definition of 'light' entertainment.,1
154664, Paranormal Activity 3 is an effective and genuinely scary prequel-slash-threequel that effectively expands the story and won't disappoint fans of the first two films.,1

191601," There's a lot of cleverness here, but neither heart nor a spirit of true insanity. BURN AFTER READING is watchable for a number of reasons, but it never really heats up.",1
186572," Yet another dispiriting reminder that while the MPAA can be squeamish and hypocritical about depictions of sexuality, filmmakers can nevertheless flood the screen with enough carnage for a world war or two, yet walk away with an R rating.",0
20639, I was not charmed. I was not moved.,0
215677, This remake is neither an expose of police brutality nor a vicarious-pleasure action movie.,0

99951," In lieu of tightly-woven plotting, Dan Gilroy instead gives us something far looser at the seams, studying a character with close intimacy and seeing what they would do rather than forcing a plot on them.",1
100618," Patton, who excels at projecting confidence and cool, can't seem to get a handle on the movie's insecure heroine, and overcompensates with broadly cartoonish gestures and facial contortions.",0
55635, Utilizes its slum locale not for inquisitive sociological inquiry but blah melodrama and stereotypical gangster histrionics.,0
214334," ...focused though [Proyas] may be on providing a classic tale of the woes of conformity and the benefits of individuality, he succeeds principally in creating visual grandeur.",0
122848," Lynne Ramsay conserves the essence of film noir, but presents them in such a innovative way that they seem almost unrecognizable. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
125281," Moments of brevity are a welcome distraction, but the film's biggest laughs come at its own expense.",0

84176," Zombieland is nowhere near the classic it has been labelled, and is more a film that will be encrusted in this time and place. Give it a few years, and it will seem as relevant as the latest game console. ",1

31940, I did not find THE WIFE at all amusing or urbane.,0
6287," Like its predecessors, ""Scream 4"" replaces the values of storytelling and suspense with the value of being in on the joke. Unfortunately, in the 11 years since ""Scream 3,"" the joke has gotten pretty old.",0
181096," The film's social commentary unspools quietly in the background while the narrative focuses on the ennui, free-floating anxiety, and inchoate longing for meaning experienced by two or three privileged young people from the middle- to upper-middle classes.",1
52623," ""The Dinner"" is an exercise in prolonged frustration. Check, please?",0
86929," It falls into a lot of the same pitfalls that the music of this era did; it starts out fun, catchy, and has a great hook, but then it gets full of itself, bloated, difficult to work with, and by the time it realizes it made a mistake, the magic is gone.",0

30728," ""Soul Power"" is an imperfect social document of a time when anything seemed possible. Here's proof that Michael Jackson never had a thing on James Brown.",1

176914, Suicide Squad is an exposition dump masquerading as a cinematic experience.,0
113731," ""Maleficent"" is rather good, mostly because of Jolie. She does grab your attention. But, overall, the movie lacks the Disney charm that has carried its fantasies - live action and animated - into the hearts and minds of viewers.",1

194178, [The Ritual] delivers here is a decent effort just in time for the Halloween season.,1
152301," It wouldn't seem possible, but this is yet another fractured fairy tale in which the characters subvert their own genre in self-conscious, smart-alecky fashion.",0

12601, An unfunny and overlong sea romp.,0

155450, [Laps] itself in a race towards tastelessness that no one asked it to run.,0
90869," [C]ommendably daring in its rational, distrusting slant on a biblical narrative, but there's no ignoring that something fundamental is lost in the movie's translation.",0
33738," This is a superb movie, one which looks bound to pick up awards and to confirm Ford's position as every bit as important a figure in cinema as in fashion.",1
198375, It's definitely one of the better guilty pleasures of 2008...,1
35506, The fact that A-list film-makers such as Scott and Helgeland can't even be bothered to come up with a dumb movie explanation to justify the moronic nature of their work feels symptomatic of the contempt Hollywood increasingly has for its audience.,0

66441," Colette is a character-driven movie, but also one that is sending a message about social mores and their malleability.",1
44181," What's most touching in Dolores is the discussion of how Huerta's work took her away from her children, and how both mother and children have reconciled that over the years. That element shows Huerta as more than the sum of her historic moments.",1
178591, After the exhilarating shock of the opening this rapidly becomes monotonous and unpleasant.,0
87527, Ghost House belongs to the long tradition of movies about white people carelessly blundering into other cultures and wreaking havoc.,0
234394, There is quite a lot of onscreen reading to be done as well as watching but the passages of Lemkin that Belzberg chooses are always well-illustrated either by the animation or archival footage.,1
74411," From the opening shot of a champagne bottle floating in space to the pulsating ribbon of an engulfing Nexus, the film's images dazzled me. ",1
221082, Talk about beating a man when he's down in the opinion polls!,1
124930," The overall charm just about carries the glibness of the psychological payoff, and the way that different veins of imagery interlock gives the film a cogency that later Fellini has woefully lacked.",1
70491," The good parts of this movie are often wonderful, but Apatow never finds the rhythm to keep it going. It lurches from inspiration to inspiration, but always manages to muddy its feet in mediocrity in between, as it drags on toward the two-and-a-half-hour",0

109116, An awkward horror pic.,0
135927," Wahlberg and Russell are solid in their roles, well complemented by the versatile Malkovich, and fans will enjoy seeing Leland in action after his previous work in Berg films.",1
155658," the film really lives out the metaphor realistically, just like Life ",1
215278," Baruh may have bitten off more than he can chew for his first feature. That said, the practical effects, blood-soaked kills, and devilish grin of the always brilliant Crampton were enough for me to walk out smiling.",1
202847," If they really want to appear radical the next time out, my advice is: Tell a single story and tell it well. What a concept.",1
71661," It's a rattling experience, a one-long-night-in-New-York movie that's set in the present but filtered through the scuzzy gaze of the city's past. I kind of loved it.",1
131253," Visually stunning and marginally intriguing, but often drags, lacks palpable thrills, and leaves you feeling underwhelmed and unimpressed by the dull story.",0
57563," One of the most self indulgent auteur efforts in recent memory. It's an absolute chore to sit through, and the threat of a sequel is more than likely to kill off the director's career altogether.",0
225532," This film is like me asking a woman out on date. It's trying very hard and seems to be on the verge of success, but it ends in disaster no matter how earnest the approach.",0
130312," It's a Weinstein release, but I don't foresee any big Oscar push for this wacky misfire.",0
55806, Gets dumber and dumber as it sinks further and further into a story that makes less and less sense as it tangles itself up in more and more inconsistent 'folklore.',0
182562," This claustrophobic Portrait of a Lady is the kind of failure only a very gifted filmmaker could make: like it or not, it haunts you.",0
35683," Showing a fondness for overtly sexual and in particular phallic imagery, Allen strains too hard to make Under Milk Wood a feast for the eyes as much as the ears.",0
236551, Brosnan's Crown is as charming as his lifestyle; Russo's Banning is smart and sexy!,1
28303," The pacing is so zany, the jokes are so rapid-fire and the sight gags are so inspired that it's impossible not to get caught up in the infectious energy of it all.",1

66619," Jobs, which toys with the idea illuminating a man, ultimately shows that it's really only interested in solidifying him as a figurehead.",0
237159," Just funny enough to recommend, although other than some incestuous father-daughter sexual tension, there's nothing particularly novel or memorable about this cliché-ridden variation on the time-travel comedy theme.",1
175708," The rest of the movie isn't as graphically awful as its centerpiece torture sequence, but it does little more than flatly illustrate the obvious-namely, that the drug war is very bad news for ordinary, well-meaning Mexicans.",0
114032," With its saccharine score, saturated cinematography, and trite platitudes, the film is formulaic and forgettable except for Kurt Russell's performance as the lovable legend.",0
212960," This may seem like a frivolous thing to take away from the film but after seeing women depicted in such a way for a long enough time, you start to pick up and appreciate when women are portrayed better.",1
68778," 'The Railway Man' deals with some of the uglier aspects of war, namely how torture can be justified by the upper echelons of government through twisted language...",1

227474," An intimate, well-played disquisition on what it means to be a Palestinian abroad versus a Palestinian at home.",1
91286," The movie doesn't eagerly jump from one payoff to another, but attunes itself to nuance, body language and the habitual politeness with which we try to overlook social embarrassment.",1

43789," Waititi and Clement possess an uncanny knack for knowing just when they're in danger of draining their ingenious premise dry, and at 86 minutes, What We Do in the Shadows stays funny without dragging on for an eternity.",1
208913, Don't Think Twice continues Birbiglia's impressive form with a funny and poignant alternative from the typical studio comedy.,1
13540, This is the kind of story that could be played straight. But Foranzi and Cattet are wholly uninterested in turning this into some rote crime procedural. They layer the action with a kind of orgiastic expressionism that can be highly provocative.,1
81639," Love triangle period pieces set against the backdrop of war all start out as ""Doctor Zhivago,"" and wind up as ""The English Patient"" -- or worse. ",0
20857," Psychosis come in many forms here, and as these two characters negotiate with each other where one's ideal ends and the other's begins, Torrens treats the viewer to a twisted sadomasochistic love story.",1
76940," A dark and emotionally complex movie for grownups, this prequel to the Marvel Comics X-Men franchise is exactly what its title suffix says.",1
201383," If you're of a mind to believe a dreary and far-fetched thriller about numerology-crazed alien life forms, then you may find the movie mildly diverting.",0
67308," The movie falls apart, and flounders to the end, because it doesn't know what its funny is supposed to be.",0
37973," Though Natalie Portman buoys the film with her heartfelt turn as the naïve heroine Novalee Nation, this cloying portrait of personal transformation has all the impact of a TV movie -- dotted with Wal-Mart commercials.",0

72868," A handsomely mounted but frustratingly mannered period drama that, in addition to its many other problems, ends just when things appear to be getting really interesting.",0
24314," But the movie does find fresh ways to tweak the formula, making it more than the sum of its broad strokes.",1

45969," The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct.",0
3564, I'd love to bottle what Lemon has and sprinkle it on other comedies.,1
39183, An off-kilter film that leaves too many promising elements behind to make room for more capering and raging from Gere. ,0
240525," The essential smack of trickery is lost throughout the picture every time an obvious effect is used, which eventually spills over into the story elements when Burger goes for toothless attempts at misdirection.",0
43396," I kept hoping that Marshall would take off and soar, which it never quite does... but it tells its story well. ",1

58795," Opera and theater director William Oldroy's first film can not only appear with dignity on any best of the year list, but it is also a perverse accompaniment / contrast piece to the first film Jordan Peele directed [Get Out]. [Full review in Spanish]",1

30965, A harrowing but ultimately empty indie political thriller about Muslim terrorists.,0
175985," I loved everything about this affecting and exquisitely made tearjerker whose themes of love, loss and sacrifice rise and fall like the waves on the ocean. Cinematic, poetic and always accessible",1
69834," Since all the second-hand ingredients are delivered without much style or flair, the movie makes for a pretty insipid dish.",0

188447, Abel Ferrara tries (and fails) to solve the riddle of who killed the famed Italian director.,0
3235," Robbie dives into the role like she's fearlessly attempting a triple axel. It's a rangy role that could have fallen into parody, but Robbie seems to hold a genuine affinity for Harding. This movie would not be what it is without that.",1

36340," The glow and texture of the Disney brush reach new heights, especially in the treatment of a summer thunderstorm and a raging snowstorm.",1
181200, The writing is blatantly sexual but utterly unrevealing; the characters and their problems are cut to fit the airtight plot.,0

171271," ""The Guard"" is not the most original buddy-cop movie you'll see, but it well may be one of the most entertaining.",1
179554, I Am Legend is far from a feel-good film; it's a familiar (for fans of Stephen King's The Stand or Heston's Omega Man) post-apocalyptic adventure rife with chills and hopelessness.,1

60786," It's rare to find media that's genuinely touching without being cloying. Yes, Inside Out is cute - but not distractingly so. Its laughs and tears are earned, in every frame.",1
121440, This almost three-hour epic keeps shooting for the stars but usually crash-lands with a thud. Someone should have told co-writer/director Baz Luhrmann that just because you call your movie Australia doesn't mean you've created a national epic.,0
10824," This is not a film which challenges the stereotypes of teen coming of age movies. However the dialogue is sharp, and Powley's comic timing is well-tuned.",1
193055," The sheer dreamy silliness of Will Ferrell's new comedy, Blades of Glory, carries it for a remarkably long time. Even after the movie starts recycling ideas and turns formulaic with an overextended chase sequence, it's impossible to dislike.",1

177635," A solid plot, one with credible sci-fi twists but also heart. It throws off the jokiness in which this series has been mired to create action-adventure in service to story. ",1

162507, This is one of the dopiest movies of the year.,0
164613," The fight scenes are well-handled and Eastwood includes several nice touches, such as the way Maggie practically gallops into every fight, or the smile on Frankie's face when she wins her first match.",1

94928," ""Quirky,"" ""cute,"" and ""weird"" may be overused adjectives, but sometimes those words fit, and sometimes those tropes do work well. ",1

38559, Goofy but amiable comedy with great country music.,0
199659, It's a tempestuous up and down storyline of laughing and sighing.,1
241039, It's easy to overlook the cornball cheesiness of such a fun and joyous film. It's much harder to overlook the glaring lie around which Universal's marketing strategy is built.,0
151801," Several powerful narratives vie for supremacy in the political drama ""The Forgiven,"" but this sluggishly paced film's disparate parts never come together as a compelling whole.",0
190483," Cute idea, but the movie can't decide whether it wants to be a full-on action flick or a goofball comedy, and it never finds a unifying tone.",0

35508, Even When I Fall is a fascinating film which shines the light on a cruel trade.,1
166644," ... if you're up for sea serpents, exploding fat men, and an impressively insane performance from Eva Green, then ""300: Rise Of An Empire"" should entertain you tremendously.",1
23484," A mirthless, sparkless ""comedy"" of galley journalism and tyro Bohemianism in 1960s Puerto Rico.",0
86736," ""Antichrist"" is a curious mash-up of cutting-edge torture-porn and good old porn-porn that fails on both fronts.",0

102570," In this summer of raunchy, hilarious R-rated comedies, Virgin fits right in--even if the one-joke premise gets a little stale towards the end. ",1
169462, A movie trying so hard to be cool that it winds up as nothing more than a flamboyant but empty exercise in self-indulgence.,0
151169," The success of the TV series was due to the brilliance of Don Adams, Barbara Feldon, and Edward Platt. Carrell, Hathaway, and Arkin miss the mark by miles.",0
171818," Unlike its main character, it is not a great work of art. But it is a most agreeable, pleasurable cinematic calling card.",1
203692," Suffers from a ceaselessly roving camera and overuse of shaky handhelds, as well as even less successful editing tropes, and some very fake-looking blood.",0

125656," DuVernay creates a cogent, compelling argument in 13th, which balances attractively filmed talking-head interviews with alternately heartbreaking and infuriating archival footage.",1
214522," As a dark, Eastern European take on ""Benji the Hunted,"" ""White God"" holds some fascination. But as an indictment of the evil that men do, it's all bark and no bite.",1
218219," It's as if Daley and Goldstein started with a list of disgusting topics - outré sex acts, human waste, pubic hair, projectile vomiting, cow cannibalism, et al. - and constructed a narrative around them.",0

169240," you'd think evil would have multiple game plans, kinda like Joe Gibbs or Bill Parcells. Instead, Hawley and Harlin just want to reenact their favorite scenes from the original",0
33766," [A] mean-spirited, one-gag time waster.",0
129912," The special effects weren't all that great either... honestly, I've seen some D-list movies that have better effects than Assassin's Creed.",0
127997," If you're over eight years old... it'd be best to avoid this, lest your good opinions of snarksters like Bill Murray, Billy Connolly, and Tim Curry be forever besmirched...",0
35354," The movie is fun for a while, then you might be tempted to dance right out of the theatre. It's a little too preachy to be all happy.",0

21977, Director James Foley has made some decent thrillers in his time but simply can't find a way to whip up any dramatic interest here whatsoever.,0

175124," The work of [director Ferenc Törok] is, first of all, a film of contrasts, of extremes in dispute. [Full review in Spanish]",1
88884, I can't help it. I was just bored of the Rings.,0
36715, A film that while quite personal in its storytelling comes without the rigor or the power of an independent filmmaking voice.,0

64491," The good news is that with Neighbors, you get the movie you're promised, and it's funny; the better news is that Neighbors is also so much smarter than that ; its high points far outshine the low ones, ",1
173901, There's nothing new in The Standoff at Sparrow Creek except the title.,0
76849," The results are unwieldy, uneven, and overlong to say the least.",0
6418," This is about two people who didn't know what their lives were until they met each other, then scrambling, in their muted, buttoned-up way, to figure out what happens next. Haynes loves them so much that he believes they can. You will too.",1
118669," It's hard to fault HBO for letting him indulge in this flight of fancy, particularly given all the marquee names he attracts. Still, without an ability to focus those appetites, Clear History yields the occasional chuckle, but somewhat curbed enthusiasm.",0
186636," This is Gallery of Blood, then, a satire on art v commerce that wants to be as camp as it is horrific, yet only manages a thin watercolour wash of either. ",0
54113," It's not a great superhero fantasy but it's a good one -- genuine fun, thank heaven.",1

123907," Waltz With Bashir is a supremely courageous act, not only as a piece of filmmaking, but much more so as a moral testament.",1

17460," Besides not being a terribly good Bond entry, it's also a poorly made film.",0
92602," With Monsters, Edwards transcends the special-effects auteur label, creating a memorable sci-fi story in which the hero and heroine are true equals in the adventure. How's that for an alien concept?",1
148660," Another Earth ignores the fascinating sociological, political and scientific implications...and instead treats it as an extended metaphor in an aggravatingly melodramatic plot.",0
63664," With his eyes goggling and his gob smudging all over the place, he looks like a haunted painting.",0
202893, ...could have worked as a bracing reminder that superheroes don't exist and that their movies can't save us - if only it had taken the implicit themes of the novel further.,1
42366, Don't get me wrong. The film is seldom boring and I certainly never hated sitting in my seat taking it all in.,0

55466," Ludicrously, hilariously entertaining.",0
62585," Rough even by Russell's standards, this grab bag of dropped plot points, visual metaphors, and theatrical cues looks like the underdrawing of a comic drama, only half covered in bright impasto strokes.",0
88940," Ultimately, the climax of the film undercuts his character's ethically grey nature - and slashes away at the story's potential.",0
71390, This battle-for-survival-type drama treads familiar territory and offers some warmth but never seems quite as powerful as it should be.,1
15228," The cruelly obvious third act congeals the film as a wet-eyed monument to the Kevin Costner character's particular brand of American manliness, one that values gut instinct, it's implied, over cold and ruthless calculations.",0
107032," Curiously smug and overly self-aware, [it's] exceedingly busy, but lacking in the heart and humor that were hallmarks of its predecessor.",0
169343, The Library Suicides concludes with the sort of narrative turn that actively sours what's come before it.,0
133773," The set-up suggests pitch-black satire, but the movie is terrified of laughing at itself.",0
5428," I won't deny that the film is sometimes rushed, oversimplified and skimpy on the details of Afghan culture that informed the book. But the tale still takes hold.",1
161470," What we mostly get is weak set-up and foreseeable deaths, though the film is not without some occasionally surprising plot turns.",0
107016," The Survivalist is a cracking, tense drama set mostly in a wooden shack in the backwoods of Ireland, in a post-apocalyptic world not far from our own, where oil and other resources have run out.",1
65753," If you liked Webb's enormously popular but, to this critic's mind, horribly pandering (500 Days) of Summer, you'll probably enjoy this too.",0
126171, It's the sort of movie that makes people feel like they've heard an important statement without actually having said anything much.,0
220377," The smug ""It's our party and you're not invited"" vibe of the second film is gone, replaced by a fizzy sense of shady glamour that makes an insanely complicated story of scams and swindles go down as smoothly as an ice-cold Bellini.",1
240108," Pee-wee's Big Holiday is a spirited blast from the past that doesn't lose focus on what made Reubens such an enigma years ago. It's not exactly the repeat masterpiece of yesteryear, but that was never going to happen.",1
37677, A fascinating yet flawed study of modern feminism.,1

246646, The title is better than the film.,0
154180," What I don't know about gospel music could fill a library, but I'm willing to learn, and the lively documentary called Rejoice and Shout is a perfect tutorial. What's more, it's certain to create a flock of converts to this soulful brand of American...",1

29005," When a cranky older woman meets a plucky younger woman, it's a safe bet that formula will prevail.",0
249109, Spews noxious gas and obnoxious patter.,0
190196," It's loaded with enough action and emotion to lure in audiences not steeped in comic book minutia, but also peppered with enough tie-ins and callbacks to send a tingle up the legs of the faithful. ",1
93477," Comedy is comedy, and ""terminal illness"" is ""terminal illness"" and the two really shouldn't meet. What you end up with is a movie that's literally as funny as cancer.",0
247832," ...an exciting parable about new millennium high tech, money and power.",1
150451," Provides a more kid friendly alternative to the glut of superhero movies currently haunting cinemas, yet doesn't lose any of its dramatic power while being so. ",1

204370," The film, like Timecode, is no more than a fascinating stunt. ... After a while, it's hard to stay awake.",0
64454," At once both convoluted and shallow, something like a feature movie version of a Wired sidebar, and just about as fleet-footed.",0

83228, It is completely bonkers so it won't be for everyone but I enjoyed it.,1

82784, A sky-watching doc that could be the most calming 78 minutes of your summer (this side of actually getting out of town and seeing the real thing). ,1
49187," The fabulous retro look and joie de vivre of this French lark are so infectious, it's easy to forgive its fatal flaw: Watching someone type is just not that interesting.",1
75826," By the film's conclusion, after many arresting sequences and just as many that drag, emotion hasn't built as effectively as it could if the film had been edited more mercilessly.",1
201843," The climax is suitably violent, and I honestly love the fact that Prows keeps the blood and gore to a minimum.",1
222526, A good imitation of the Muppet style.,1
27075," They could have called this one something else entirely - ""The Driver,"" say, or ""The Courier"" - and the way it sold the movie's uniqueness would have been just as legitimate. Or just as forced.",0

29485," The Weiders denounced drinking and espoused protein shakes, but the film suggests you can never have too much cheese.",0
80503," Devoid of any subtlety, bereft of a strong plot, and embarrassingly misguided toward its disability narrative, Blind really has nothing to recommend it.",0
115927," The beats of the movie, not to mention the winking title and the time period, make A Most Violent Year feel like it should be another bloody tale about the dark side of American greed. But Chandor is too smart to go down that path.",1

194189," It is hugely impressive that, given what was at stake, Nolan has managed to not only pull this out of the bag, but to absolutely nail it. The film is as all-encompassing as the concept of its title: grand, epic, smart and unforgettable.",1
217316," The Kleptocrats ... manages ... to tell a nearly unbelievable documentary tale with jaunty verve and panache, almost belying the awful crimes uncovered within.",1
240104," The good news of ""Cake"" is that it proves that Aniston can be appealing without being exalted or gorgeous, by simply being average.",1
181958, The vacillations of the script are as constant as the boats attacked by the shark. [Full review in Spanish],0
89799," ""The Invitation"", a title that alludes to a part of the story, it also seems to open the doors of the plot to the audience, positioning us before a set of characters that face loss and grief, looking for answers and a way to cope. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
20035," The kind of sentimental, patently false romantic pandering whose idea of resolving a scene is for everyone to engage in some cute form of eccentric group activity.",0
224469, You expect better from George Clooney,0
127551," As much a knockabout comedy -- the almost skeletal Bale performs with the goofy, loose-limbed exuberance of the young Jerry Lewis -- as a traditional boxing movie or inspirational drama of overcoming addiction.",1
175944," I loved how the musical numbers exploded inside of Guido's psyche, each of them having a cinematic pizzazz showing exactly what it must be like to reside within the character's brainpan.",1
156443," The NWA story is told in the style of a luxe, classic-era studio biopic. And it's scintillating.",1
96273, A wonderful combination of explorer survivalist adventure and crucially important science.,1
82359," There's not much to say about the plot. Second Best suffers from sequelitis, as so many sequels do, in that it's just more of the same.",0
42895," I'm always wary of that overused word 'masterpiece', but this is one film that deserves the accolade.",1
180824," The instability bleeds into the fabric of the film itself, and until the very end, it is thrillingly hard to prise open its puzzle-box lid.",1
213085," ""Red Army"" is one of the best documentaries from 2014",1
152998," There was reason to believe that ""Jaws 2"" would be a mess. It isn't. It's better than most sequels. It's formula-ridden but slick, and the special effects work as intended. ",1
96486," Gray's direction is painfully flat, and curiously -- especially for a popular music video director like Gray -- lacking any interesting visual style.",0
131804," A baroque blend of gibberish, mysticism and melodrama, the film seems engineered to be as unmemorable as possible, with the exception of the prosthetic teeth worn by the lead actor, Rami Malek, who plays Freddie Mercury, Queen's lead singer.",0
234826, What you're left with is a host of issues far more stimulating than the movie raising them is.,0
35536," It is rare to watch a movie where sex is treated with maturity, religion is treated with respect and characters are so heart-warmingly written and portrayed. ",1
125423, Where does Hollywood come up with such fresh and original material? ,0
97107," ... in gorgeous visual ways, unimaginable depth of human feeling.",1
178067," For film lovers, the genre-bending is gratifying. It has been a while since a horror film spoke so eloquently about something as primal as greed and remained true to its Indian (Marathi) setting.",1
171047," What Paddington 2 demonstrates is that in the currently messed-up and hectic world we currently live in, we need films like this to remind us how we need something loving to make our lives endearing, akin to the warm message of It's a Wonderful Life.",1
160575," Deadpool 2 is awesome and you should go to see it. Especially if, like me, you're suffering from a bad case of superhero fatigue. It could be good for what ails ya.",1
109564," I'd sooner believe director Gareth Edwards had hired actual extra-terrestrials to make an appearance in his film Monsters, than accept the fact that he was able to construct them with his SFX-savvy and a measly budget of $500,000.",1
16435," Szwarc means to create drama, effectively absorbing us in the adventures of a superhero flying in on the winds of the second wave of feminism. But his work lacks any playfulness or self-conscious humor.",0
114487," A sloppy, schlocky piece of work.",0
250294, Just can't hold a candle to its predecessor.,0
74547," The plot turns are playful as well as jolting, and the visual shocks are gentle: a bison on the porch, the world's largest pistachio, Mr. Penn in his makeup.",1
96184," Characters come straight from the assembly line of screenwriting archetypes, and too often they act in ways that archetypes, rather than human beings, do.",0
126571," Jersey Boys contains enough pleasant ingredients to warrant a mild recommendation, but it's clearly at its best when Clint curtails the characters' kvetching and simply lets the music play.",1
136924," Although it boasts two pretty Barbie Doll leading ladies, a flavored scenic land and watery locale and those toothy ""Jaws"" knock-offs swarming around, it still barely remains afloat with all the conviction of a defective, hole-ridden buoy.",0
188889," Adopts old Hollywood mechanics %u2014- showy marquee stars, swift-witted dialogue, character-dominated plot %u2014- and relies on an audience willing to be tricked, surprised and challenged.",1
77736," Ever After strikes an existential tone that underplays the horror a little too much... But in its quieter moments, when Vivi and Eva are alone in their eerily depopulated world, it captures something essential and disturbing.",1
226279," Ms. Burdge - all quicksilver emotion and exposed nerve endings - is an endlessly watchable focal point. Her character's vulnerability, uncertainty and growing self-acceptance lend the movie a necessary gravity.",1
80881, Neighbors 2 ends up being funnier than the original movie and a near-perfect sequel to boot.,1
124294," There is nothing in this story of star-crossed lovers that you have not seen in dozens of previous films, but it still makes for a reasonably entertaining, if unsurprising, viewing thanks to the undeniable charm of the two leads.",1
130948," ...painful, funny and honest, and the tone Garlin achieves is steady and true.",0
181438," Despite a contrived and sentimental ending, this is an entertaining riff on men and fantasy.",1
62051," A tone-deaf pantsing of the superman cause, creating an incredible ruckus as it breakdances on hallowed ground, preferring noise over wit when it comes to giving funny books a comprehensive noogie.",0
177733," All shell, no soul.",0
24132," Despite stumbling in the second half, Mowgli recovers in finding its footing in being the bold interpretation of Kipling's tales that it set out to be. It does so with additionally offering excellent performances and innovative visuals.",1
72117, The camera is the only star of this film.,0
72496," Though it ultimately arrives at an uplifting outcome, Winter on Fire also serves as a bleak prelude to Ukraine's current war with Russia.",1
172322, A zero...wants to be sweet and cheeky but comes off sour and tasteless instead. There's a difference between raunchy and tawdry.,0
118097, Charming and at times very funny.,1
7742," ...largely silly, if well meaning, inoffensive but predictable, unoriginal, and bland.",0
41197," Hunt's film does soften the heart, not least because of its honesty and its sensitivity to some unfashionable dilemmas.",1

18213, Fantasies as hearty and original as this are rare at the movies.,1
174347," It may be the best ""not just a pretty face"" story in the history of the world.",1
222517," It's a classic case of the filmmakers trying to do too much, weaving too many characters into too many circumstances for any kind of satisfactory extrication to take place.",0

164724," Absolutely bloody brilliant. Brutal, foul-mouthed and tragic.",1
175387, A hit-and-miss affair with some scenes and relationships ringing true and others drowning in a deep pool of artifice.,0
13988," While the pictures are pretty and the whole enterprise takes itself ever so seriously, The Village is not nearly as frightening as it thinks it is.",0

28974," ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is overflowing with action, passionate performances, and is just completely and totally engrossing from beginning to end. Some are calling it a masterpiece, but it doesn't obtain the same level of brilliance its predecessor did. ",1

153801," With a wild-card character like Dignan, he could be either the most original character in many a moon -- or never convincing. Wilson, with his cockeyed grin and rapid-fire delivery, comes off as a young Dennis Hopper.",1

188244," As a filmmaker's ambitious attempt to wrestle with big, answerable questions, Downsizing is an interesting artifact. As an actual movie, though, it's an awkward misfire.",0
246298," In many ways, this is the strongest Superman reboot for a long time. Yet the story manages to be both rushed and overlong, and Snyder doesn't know when to say stop.",0
