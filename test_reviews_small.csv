30500, Entertaining date movie but bland and predictable.,1
29293," Comedian Katt Williams, in a small role as a chipper hitchhiker, injects about 15 minutes worth of fun into Father Figures, an otherwise mostly dreadful road comedy in which Ed Helms and Owen Wilson play twins searching for a man to call dad.",0
15862," Reminiscent of the work of Michael Haneke and Lars von Trier, director Yorgos Lanthimos's film is disquieting, provocative and either frustratingly ambiguous or richly allegorical depending on your point of view.",1

6848," A casually racist murder-mystery (minus the mystery) that was rejected by both audiences and critics due to a chaotic tone, insipid comedy beats and clunky action scenes set to slap-bass and scat-singing.",0

49702," The trouble with that is that Beyond the Hills seems like a movie that's been almost preconceived to be powerful. There's a grandiosity to it, but not much mystery.",0
61095," Skyfall epitomizes what a Bond movie should be, and its director, for once, justifiably deserves much of the credit.",1
64007, I think we were all perfectly content with our vague memories of shag hairdos... there will always be DVD to remind us how bad the original series was. We certainly didn't need a bad new series to drive the point home.,0

61973," The argument in favor of The Square is not that it's great fun to watch, but that it's very entertaining to ponder after viewing. It lingers, both amusingly and disturbingly.",1
64343," In the end, it tosses exposition out the window in exchange for incredible effects and some solid frights. It'll satisfy that B-movie craving for some good ol' fashioned zombie fightin'.",1

43344, Arriving on the scene just in time to feast on (500) Days of Summer's sloppy seconds.,0
53650," Ultimately, the buildup is so good, it's inevitable that the payoff disappoints. Maybe that's why the finale seems intentionally vague; it doesn't matter what happens -- it's about the trip, not the destination.",1
49022," If I have not yet convinced you of the movie's astonishingly slipshod quality, I'm unlikely ever to do so.",0
21995," It's generally compelling, even if the film seems to target the financially savvy more than the working-class folks who are most affected by the events it chronicles.",1
22196, A light and playful look at the Manchester music scene which spans from the punk explosion to the dawn of acid house.,1
66442," Quite entertaining as an entry in this tried-and-true genre of ""guys going on a inadvertent wacky adventure,"" and I like how this one is set up as a kind of mystery.",1

71503," ... has elements of horror, comedy, mystery and supernatural thriller, but winds up only as a slick and sporadically amusing oddity.",0
17780," For a movie about a centuries-old battle between vampires and werewolves, Underworld proves to be a surprisingly toothless affair.",0
81035," Whatever, dude. Unlike Moore, I have homes on both sides of the border and it's the Quebec one I keep locked.",0

13480, Jane Austen would spin in her nearly 200-year-old grave at the crude and broad movie made in her name.,0
59394, Ascher's hugely enjoyable docu-collage of Shining theories embraces ambiguity but proves that Kubrick's deep chiller is worth the revisits.,1

62918, Xavier Giannoli hasn't settled for lavish and funny alone but has also aimed high to make his film surprisingly deep.,1
25845," There are dozens of charming moments, but the story is simply too thin to carry the movie's 87-minute running time.",0
68509," Running a scant 90 minutes, it often feels as if a couple reels ended up on the cutting-room floor. Connery is absolutely delightful, though.",0
71948, This well-crafted work deserves to be seen for its thorough account of intricate workings of secret service and political skullduggery.,1

67076, On a practical level it's hard not to see that nearly every calamity in Babel could have been avoided had the characters exercised better judgment,0
79370," Watch Big Game with a straight face and it's ridiculous; view it as tongue-in-cheek (and Rare Exports proved that Helander has a wicked sense of humour) and, if not sublime, it's certainly entertaining.",1
72629," What Murphy is doing here, in fact, is so focused and inventive, I don't quite know what to call it. Comedy nouveau, perhaps?",1
59071, Is it a good film? Not even close. Did the director misuse good actors? Definitely.,0
43486, A real-life screwball comedy with a solid gold cast. Grant may have just sealed his first Oscar nomination.,1
15482, A mildly entertaining and mostly painless family film that provides spark plug Quvenzhane Wallis an extended opportunity to show off her star qualities.,1
65301," As moving as Mr. de la Manitou's testimony sometimes is, this movie too often feels like a credulity-straining attempt at hagiography.",0
69017," Again, we have to experience the George Lucas formula post Jedi; great visuals with an AWFUL SCRIPT that felt like it was written by a 3 year old. This time around, Lucas delves into the BABY TALK world.",0
22899," while [Bahrani] did create a sociologic examination of an industry and culture that effects everyone, and educates the audiences, he didn't know how to end the story. ",0

57165," ""Somewhere"" is an undeniably minor film. But if you""re willing to be indulgent, you""ll find surprising pleasures hidden within.",1
67898," An ungainly ghostly potboiler that digs furiously away in the same thematic graveyard as this summer's most revelatory sleeper hit, but doesn't unearth anything that's worthy of attention.",0
37559," Combat scenes seem more interested in the faces than the fracas, missions are undertaken with no apparent outcome, and great difficulties loom and then dissolve like mist.",0
35058," ""Hey, look who's here,"" the film says excitedly as Rudd and Fey routinely attempt to make a stale screenplay humorous, ""Why aren't you laughing at them?""",0
76161," On the whole, Tik Tik Tik could have been much more considering the newness of its genre, but the attempt is certainly a laudable one.",1
50941," As neat as the organizing premise sounds, it's exhausting to commit to this many points of view in such a small amount of time. And several of the films are just awful.",0

76442, There hasn't been a piece of warped Americana this ugly since the 2003 documentary Capturing the Friedmans. Harding's humanity means less to the filmmakers than does the possibility of her guilt. ,0
71265," Although Borgman can accurately be described as part psychological horror movie, part modern fairy tale, it unfolds within a world so realistic it's jarring and genuinely creepy like Rosemary's Baby.",1
2954," The new Harry Potter prequel feels more like a history lesson in our favorite magical scoundrels than anything new or entertaining, and still manages to have little plot or even the secretive mysteries that normally characterize these films",0

2211," While the climactic chariot race comes close to delivering the same level of hoof-pounding thrills that helped make William Wyler's 1959 version an Oscar-sweeping classic, this sappy retread makes audiences endure a lot of mediocrity to get there.",0
25865," 100 Streets has passion and is well-meaning, but the film's plot often misfires and leaves a sense of emptiness in its wake.",0
66574," A nice trip to the past thanks to the amazing performances, beautiful photography and light humor. [Full review in Spanish]",1

70657," Pitched as a homage to George Cukor's 1949 classic romantic comedy ""Adam's Rib"" (with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy), ""Laws of Attraction"" is far separated from that film's exceptional timing and sincere comic exploration of a competitive couple of",0

52766, Only the sublimely snakey Grant emerges unscathed,0
66115," Judged on its own terms, A Wrinkle in Time is a pretty good, perhaps even a quite good, movie. But it is a children's movie. See it with a child or--as DuVernay recommends--with a child's wonder. Otherwise, probably don't bother seeing it at all.",1

50499," Dayveon simply cribs from the Southern-fried playbook of its own big-name producer, David Gordon Green.",0

77578," ... truly heartwarming, humorous and touching film...",1
48658, A mesmerizingly ambivalent documentary about an itinerant family of Jewish surfer-dude health nuts.,1
57647, It is so intriguing.,1
71842, All three central performances are among what is right with Chloe. It is just too bad they are not supported by a better script.,0
58632," Mr. Kornbluth's documentary argues eloquently for such unassailable goals as investment in education and infrastructure, and complements Mr. Reich's exposition with compelling interviews ...",1
36518," It's a fine mesh, well-costumed and well-shot, yet, weirdly, it never ignites as intended.",0
42356," The Lazarus Effect is a wag-the-dog film, where the filmmakers had a good idea of how to end the movie, but didn't put the required work into selling the setup.",0
60508," Stern on the surface, yet entirely human look at religion, femininity and faith.",1
15363," Tomorrowland is strong on character, action and a general sense of wonder, but it needs to take a good, hard look at itself when it comes to tying up plot strands in a satisfying manner.",0
11751," The Informant! is one of [Soderbergh's] ugliest works, photographed on the RED digital camera system in such a way that depth of field is meaninglessly flattened into backlit brown mush.",0
3348," 'Closer to Kill Bill than Crouching Tiger, it's a step backwards for the director...but still a beautiful film'",1
26100," It's a historical war movie with impressive sweep, strong characterizations and the kind of idiosyncratic flourishes that made Woo such an irresistible storyteller.",1
71886," Horizon is visually spectacular, positively bludgeoning you with that emotional baseball bat. But it's the strong performances from Wahlberg, Russell, and co. that firmly secure the ORWAV seal of approval.",1

34479, Equal parts taut and titillating... until it jumps the shark in its final act.,1
79114," Apparently too much eye of newt got into the formula for Hocus Pocus, transforming a potentially wicked Bette Midler vehicle into an unholy mess.",0
6253," The man made famous by Ferris Bueller, however, quickly wades into waters far too deep for him.",0
4586," Rather than crafting a movie that's so bad it's good, writer-director brothers Jason and Brandon Trost have come up with something that's just plain bad -- and boring, and repetitive.",0
74362," The film ties itself in knots trying to be both historical account and ripping adventure - 'Schindler's List' by way of 'The Dirty Dozen'. In the end neither aspect satisfies, resulting in a drab if diverting Sunday afternoon spectacle.",0
6484, What should be a moving story is ruined by hideous acting and sloppy filmmaking.,0
3999," The movie consists of endless declamation, endless violence.",0
73326, This neatly written Heathers-meets-Groundhog Day high-concept package delivers both technical polish and a toothsome yet likeable cast.,1
32240, The stars never fully align as the interesting threads Morley scatters about come to nothing in a dime-a-dozen ending.,0
61097, The story is full of holes and the narrative leans too often on ballads and 'sad songs' to establish mood.,0

62304," The picture offers no boundaries for Wright's vision, but the wide open space confuses the talented helmer. This isn't a bad movie, it's merely a punishingly permissive one. ",0

30263," Weak source material split into two films for no creative advantage only results in a disappointing artistic decision ruled by financial greed. The film anti-climatically makes us wait and leaves us asking: ""For what?""",0

10841," If all the vulgarity and cheap shots were excised the movie would only be 30 minutes long. Filmmakers often shoot tamer versions of the same scene for TV; ""Vacation"" must have required separate scripts.",0

49471, A well-acted trifle straining to be a hard-hitting morality play.,0
41234," As lovely as it sometimes is, what this film needs is a little more shape and a little less ambience. It's a delicate balance admittedly tricky to achieve, but one that is clearly within the capability of this talented new filmmaker.",1
60585, I Am Love isn't just a bedazzlement to the eyes and ears. It's a feast--or maybe just a small but divine dish of prawns--for the soul.,1
48416," Memento doesn't just draw you into a dramatic mystery, it makes you aware of human mystery. And that's food for thought and entertainment.",1
65415, Visceral. Textural. Interesting.,1
2721," Although its last half hour doesn't come through as expected and the film changes its tune dramatically by looking at the aftermath of the event, the first hour is well worth a watch.",1

74774," The film is more of the same and we're talking about some significantly diminished returns, but there's some real entertainment value here. ",1
3222," If you want to enjoy Liam Neeson's latest high-speed thriller at all, you'll have to do more than merely suspend disbelief. You'll have to grab it, smash it into little pieces and toss them into a black hole. ",0
32706, A fun action-packed fantasy...,1
36406, More interesting as a cinema footnote than as actual cinema; it sets modest entertainment goals for itself and flunks those.,0
14998, Writer/actor Jason Segel and his co-writer honor Jim Henson and his crew's sense of humor and perfectly capture flavor of the legendary TV and movie series.,1
65721," Funny People has some very funny moments but don't expect a joke fest. And don't expect a tight film either. At two and a half hours, it is not one but two films... and at least one of them shouldn't have been made.",0
49891," ...as though underplaying and long, silent stretches without even a musical score can somehow convey seriousness and import.",1
47158," With all the oversized personalities that surround him, Stiller gets upstaged.",0

21592," Naturally, what happened behind the scenes after Stalin's death is murky and Iannucci approaches it coldly, making The Death of Stalin a satire as funny as it is dark. [Full review in Spanish]",1
17902," At times The Shack is able to provoke real thought and introspection. But as a movie, it struggles with issues of structure and execution, which no doubt happened in the book-to-film transition.",0
65925," James Franco is firing on all his creative cylinders in this comic bonanza about Tommy Wiseau, the worst filmmaker of the 21st century. Franco hits a new career peak by making sure his film is as heartfelt as it is hilarious.",1
41374," Dylan O' Brien's debut as an action star reaches exciting points, but what happens in the middle is quite conventional. [Full review in Spanish]",1
74436," Mostly, the jokes and the recurrent attempts to tweak the superhero genre serve as a reminder that somebody else has already done it better.",0
8225," It's a gorgeous film: This may sound contradictory, but it's intricate and rough-hewn at the same time, dreamlike and earthy.",1
7725, The actors were having a much better time making the film than I did sitting in the theater watching it.,0
47887," Few movies so taken with death have felt so rudely alive as ParaNorman, the latest handcrafted marvel from the stop-motion artists at Laika.",1
35220," In many respects, ""Guardians"" ... is a fun and relatively fresh space Western.",1
57342," ""Slow West"" certainly lives up to its title: It's one poky Western, plodding and perambulating and moseying across the 1870 frontier on a grim march to a pointless ending.",0
10365, A mishmash of a movie about a May-December romantic relationship set in New York City.,0
65872, The sophistication of The Hunger Games and its sequels is setting a benchmark that none of the series' rivals has yet managed to match. This one doesn't change anything.,0
71836, ...has little new going for it beyond a boatload of energy and enthusiasm. And pure formula.,0
81716," It's true that legions of fans won't likely find the reality traumatizing once they are old enough to finally grasp it. Nevertheless, the film is hypocritical in the moral lesson it attempts to impart.",0
47521," It's glitzy and glamorous yes, and Luhrmann fans will be delighted with its staging, including the occasionally over-zealous music, but there are a few more misfires in here than they might be used to.",1
7486," Part Hoop Dreams, part Nike commercial",1
21615," Dead Pigs is a weird, weird ride. Weird in a good way? Sure, sometimes. The film is unique.",1
76699," ""Frankie and Johnny"" is a witty and bright if superficial look at '90s relationships. It is also unabashedly romantic, the primary twist being that the man wants to commit and the woman runs away.",1
60357, Cameron Diaz is the reason charter schools exist.,1
48827," Digital photography, with its limited ability to capture rapid movement, renders the close combat choppy and disorienting, and none of the kills is especially memorable. ",0
83797," Caro knows how to push viewers' buttons, and she does so every chance she gets. The weather in the movie might be chilly, but she makes sure our blood is boiling.",1
36653," A spy movie-blaxploitation picture spoof that repeats itself so often, and hits its targets so erratically, you'd swear it was adapted from a Saturday Night Live skit.",0
17873," If any of these characters had even a double-digit IQ, there'd be no movie.",0
23282," There is a passionate, combative and riveting documentary to be made about the plight of the American schoolteacher, but unfortunately the well-meaning, unfailingly decent and overly slack American Teacher isn't it.",0
58153," Ironclad might be the perfect actioner for gorehound fanboys gaga for medieval trappings, but all others may find this British-American-German co-production a bit of a drag.",0
22750, a solid stand-alone experience,1
37914," Unlikely as it sounds, this strangely compelling allegory is punctuated by nerve-wrecking action scenes, as the survivors battle against elements and circumstance.",1
67162, feels disingenuous at the end when it attempts to celebrate all that it had previously made fun of,0
18357, A disjointed mess that is never quite as hip or smart as it seems to think it is. ,0
25024," Delicately shot with a sense of intimacy, but never precious, Hide Your Smiling Faces invites you to be as inquisitive about the world as these boys are and to maybe even experience it through their eyes.",1
25915," Co-scripters Pegg and Wright structure it as a classic three-acter (set-up, journey, finale) with enough twists, character development and small set pieces to keep the comedy boiling.",1
14619, An invasion of the body snatchers is preferable to realizing that the true horror perpetrated here is not on the characters but on the audience.,0
7875," Funnier than Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, but for all the offensiveness, it's family-values to the core.",1
6691," Subplots are set up and abandoned, while every potentially comic scenario is exploited in the broadest, most groan-worthy way imaginable.",0

42819," Even though the film won't fully commit to its more experimental flourishes, Hawke makes it feel truthful in a way that conventional music biopics rarely manage.",1
63032," Instead of expounding a tedious origin story or staging an epic battle for apocalyptic stakes, ""The Wolverine"" focuses on a specific and self-contained adventure in a richly imagined place.",1
78396," Better than the first one, and twice as nasty, the Rejects should get the approval of horror fans -- or else!",1
76199," What was mildly amusing and mildly successful in 2005 has degenerated into a needless fracas among random fairy-tale characters, who have all been herded into this single film like a flock of Little Bo-Peep's defenseless sheep.",0

79790," The blend of top-notch CGI, realism, stunts, and breakneck pace keep all the exploding balls in the air, and the 3D is blissfully easy on the eyes.",1
68455," Rio Bravo is everything you likely ever imagined a western to be, and a little bit more.",1

58962," ...a genre film unlike any in its class, an interior journey studded with spectral stumbling blocks...",1
49256," With a face as impassively beautiful as the landscape she trudges through, Ree Dolly is a heroine you won't forget. Tenacious and stoic, she holds her own in a vernacular that's equal parts hillbilly and hard-boiled.",1
7251," As to the implausibly happy 'feelgood' ending, maybe I was too harsh, and it's quite sweet really? No. It's properly rubbish. Won't even think about trying to be kind again. It just doesn't suit.",0
19669, Its three leads certainly deserve consideration for their artfulness in being able to infuse it with intimations of quality. ,1
27613," Ortega has a real eye for flashy, chaotic set pieces and a real ear for excellent Latin rock needle drops on the film's killer Scorsese-inspired soundtrack.",1
33068," An unendurable relationship-romcom, which you should avoid the way you would a glass of punch with a frothy gob of Anthrax floating on the surface.",0
30967, It is perhaps not top-notch Haneke but Happy End is an intermittently gripping film about loveless people in a joyless world.,1
2220," In conclusion, it's not the best of Disney-Pixar, but it's definitely the best one of the saga because of its life metaphors. [Full review in Spanish]",1

7363," The Legend of Tarzan is indicative of a trend that's been plaguing cinema for a while now. This is a prime example of a Franchise Starter. It is not designed to be one movie, it's designed to be at least three movies.",0

21231, Supremely satisfying for about a dozen different reasons. A great film.,1
36372," Built around Rumsfeld's obsessive habit of pumping out memos, the film yields little insight into the deep agenda of America's war in Iraq, nor does it crack its subject's polished, affable veneer.",0

4831," It's still a good film, mostly because of Ciaran Hinds' emotionally heartfelt performance.",1
83159," The animation is crisply detailed, the voice work is solid, and the handful of musical numbers are memorably evocative of some of the fine work that Disney has done in that regard in the past.",1
13694," Making a smart genre film is a house of cards. Of Moon's praiseworthy elements, I am most impressed with this: for a movie so rich and complex, it is wonderfully simple.",1
74661, What's most shocking is that a puff of dust and cobwebs don't erupt from his mouth every time it creaks open to deliver another pun about Trollope/trollop.,0

6330," [Philippe] Falardeau's unobtrusive direction, and the restrained performance of Fellag and the child actors, make this a powerful, unsentimental film that doesn't make you feel like you're hearing a lecture.",1
32300, My disappointment comes not just from the fact that the subject matter is soft but from the fact that the film is so thin,0
4635," When the players themselves are conceived this superficially, LaBute winds up invalidating his own point.",0
21243, We have been sold a false bill of goods.,0

53903," By the way, all of you Liam Neeson fans will want your money back when it turns out he's in one scene.",0
71194, It's visually and emotionally warm and it's refreshing to see a story that's both timely (children caged by their government and abandoned by their elders) and ultimately optimistic.,1
54503," What on paper seems to be the perfect marriage of maker and material turns out to be a bust in its finished form, a stagnant movie that revisits the ghosts of Los Angeles noir past without adding much to the canon.",0

76960," Keaton's terrific, and it's sweet and airy and so unhurried you really feel like you've had a nice afternoon in the long grasses and cool breezes on the edge of the city. You wouldn't want to live there, though.",1
16657," Beyond such amateurishly ill-constructed plot points, what should be a fast-moving film is slow and repetitious.",0

79466, Laurent Cantet makes an enthralling return to form with this topical fusion of political debate session and socially conscious thriller.,1
4653, Neither lights a fuse to our brains or hearts.,0
59079, Director Anupam Sharma presides over a film bristling with supporting characters and plotlines of varying success: a melodramatic subplot involving Meera's former husband feels way out of place and references to sponsors are decidedly unsubtle.,0
77370, It's a movie that holds out hope for the movies' future.,1
7285," For whatever flaws it may have, this is a movie that gets a lot right about foster care and adoption. It might just leave you with a lump in your throat.",1
77390," It does tend to lean towards the goofy side of things and it's not particularly memorable. But, hey, the kids will certainly get a kick out of it.",0

61162, A sobering reminder of what can happen when apathy drives your politics. ,1
73944, Bad acting and stiff dialogue rear their ugly head in the opening scene and just douse the movie in their thick juices repeatedly until it ends.,0
38618," ""Indignation"" is very much the sort of venture Mr. Schamus has often championed as a producer-ambitious and provocative, a must-see for anyone who cares about independent film.",1

47895, Audiences attuned to these kind of four-person dramas will get pretty much what they expect.,1
56046," Home cunningly attempts to achieve that always-expected animated feat of being everything to everyone, but what it really proves -- with more authenticity than the content itself can muster -- is just how infrequently that can be done.",0
39207," With its soap-operatic performances, bonkbuster plotline and sparkling seafront setting, all 'Adore' really lacks is a cameo from Alf Stewart",0
17897," The main thing consumers will be looking for from Resurgence is bang-for-buck entertainment, and that it delivers reasonably successfully.",1
80183," There's something brilliant in the way directors Lord and Miller subvert Hollywood, studios and even their own audience in the rare sequel that is equal to its predecessor.",1
71115, What ends up happening is that the African scenes almost become metaphoric explanations of what's going on in this family drama and I find it frankly morally repugnant.,0
1053," Funny, touching, and heartfelt, this is a fantastic vehicle for its stars, and a moving portrait of the various things family can mean.",1
19620," This movie isn't just smart, it's also wise.",1

30925," The initial joy of Fallen Kingdom's action extravaganza is tempered by the smaller-scale feel of its second half, even as a strong ending suggests another evolution in this storyline. All of which balances out into a perfectly enjoyable franchise entry...",1
2245, A great triumph that refuses to color within typical emotional lines.,1
13959, La La Land gives two hours of pure and genuine entertainment that ratify Chazelle no longer as a promise but as one of the most talented directors on the current scene. [Full review in Spanish],1
43041," It seems that an evil aristocrat, executed for a series of murders, returns from the dead to mobilize an ancient secret society that he may have time-traveled into a Dan Brown novel to learn about. Doesn't that sound fascinating? I thought not.",0
8114," The writing/directing team of Joel and Ethan Coen create a laugh-a-minute black comedy that pokes fun at America's surveillance-dominated existence, plastic surgery desires, and all out greed.",1

38109," ""Flowers"" abounds with well-worn movie archetypes and slathers on schmaltz.",0
68873," It is poetic, honest and at times almost upsettingly real. It will be fascinating to see what Ellis does next.",1
54839, One of the things that still amazes me about this movie is the way its study of obsession is so single-minded.,1
67176," You may argue that The Nutcracker and the Four Realms hardly adopts a realistic approach to teach children life's pivotal lessons, but sometimes this is just what one needs in a time when the world is all but losing its faith in humanity.",1
18494," The thing that truly sets Mission: Impossible - Fallout apart from your average action film is its unwavering commitment to relentless, dynamic fun. Cruise and McQuarrie rev the engines from moment one and take off on the cinematic Autobahn.",1
44316," A powerful, often gruelling but supremely tender fable about two boys scrounging for scrap in Britain's industrial wasteland. ",1
44824," Scott, never known for being choosy about his roles, actually has ended up in a sweet little movie.",1

15578, Hall is this movie's center of gravity...she does a dance very familiar to working women. ,1
74481, If you are looking for a film about an unlikely friendship give To Dust a shot. It's not perfect but what it gets right is quite sweet and lovely.,1

61504," No matter how much the film wants to be an examination of race relations, it's really just a medium-grade potboiler, watchable but unmemorable.",0
76183, Offers nothing but degrading stereotypes and repulsive toilet humor.,0
67219, McGowan is a suitably slinky presence as the lead avenger with a machine gun for a leg; blood and pus regularly fill the screen as Rodriguez lets rip with gleeful abandon.,1
35425," Craven guides us expertly down a series of blind, bloody alleys, a journey that's more pleasurable than frustrating. On account of his steady hand, the last act is as good as could be expected: skillfully conceived and entertaining in its preposterousness",1
75860," THE CONSTANT GARDENER packs a real wallop in its study of the interconnections of global business, international medicine, and government. A film that has solid and relevant content, a good romance, and is still a good story is very rare. This is one of t",1
24478," All foreplay and no, well, climax.",0
59378," Engaging, well written drama with strong performances from a superb cast, but the absurdly privileged lifestyles of the characters do seem somewhat at odds with the point of the story.",1

48205," A word to the squeamish: there is no shame in leaving as the tools-and I use the word advisedly-come out. In a way, you will be getting the best of Antichrist, which until now has been a film of awkwardness, confusion, and great beauty.",1

60714, [Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana] sets up its plot with confidence and coherence before going off the rails in spectacular and painful fashion.,0
79896," Yes, there are gags about mummy penises and canine halitosis, but other sublime moments recall Albert Brooks' social-satire heyday. Given the otherworldly elements, David Koepp's ""Ghost Town"" sweetly hits the heights of Brooks' ""Defending Your Life.""",1
18233, Perpetually off-balance and maybe just a little too satisfied with its cynicism,1

15005," The thing to keep in mind is, laugh.",1
76422, It's unclear what about life or depression Foster and Killen are really saying. A movie about a man hiding behind a puppet is also a story about a movie hiding behind its star.,0

24664," Listen, come over to my place this weekend; we'll rewatch Terminator 1 and 2, we'll listen to 'You Could Be Mine' by Guns N Roses, we can even discuss Edward Furlong's 'career'. And let's just pretend Terminator Salvation never happened.",0

52247, It transforms and sturdies itself into a nice bit of remembrance for one last outburst of creativity in the life of a great artist.,1
2968, A very ordinary horror thriller without any shocking twists or surprises. If only the screenplay were half as clever and imaginative as the sound and visual design!,0
67174, It's not a comedy.,0
24210," A buddy movie and a gross-out comedy rolled into one, it's an enjoyable and clever flick, even if it arouses more gentle titters than full-on belly laughs.",1
2945," It's juvenile and bawdy and stupid and crude, but reader, I'm sorry, I laughed. Frequently. ",1

70071," There's not so much a story arc as a mess of ideas that are thrown at the screen; some stick, some don't, which means that This Is Our Land is only ever sporadically interesting. ",0
10979," A pretty nifty mystery about deranged love, and if nothing is truly startling, it's still smartly put together and completely entertaining.",1
52847," Swingers has a few good laughs here and there, but never achieves anything poignant.",0
81318," ""Southside With You"" is a sweet, romantic film, but one that is layered with intelligence, relationship, and character building. It's an engaging re-imagining of the Obamas' first date.",1
56905," The attention to detail -- always a Pixar hallmark -- is amazing, and Stanton and his crew incorporate surprising elements that mix vintage sci-fi with old musicals with a meta-cartoon rendering of the future.",1

49290, Elicits a palpable emotional and intellectual effect...strikes the same sad note of discord thirty years later.,1
24631," Perhaps the movie's idyllic small town of Radiator Springs should have been depicted through stop-motion or traditional animation, to suggest the limits as well as the appeal of the so-called good old days.",1
40572, It has the best teenage disco sequence I've seen in years.,1
61975," For all of the arms-crossed ill will that the premise engenders, writer-director Tom Tykwer has enough conviction and verve to hold your interest.",0

27824, Every storyline concludes in the same circular fizzle.,0

51594," In less qualified hands, Trance wouldn't be this entertaining. ",1
67374," As a huge fan of LaBute's usual work, I'd like to believe he intended Lakeview Terrace as a mockery of dopey conventions and that his heightened sense of irony just floated over my head.",0
55451," If Universal wants to continue the tired series after this one, we suggest they take it to Broadway instead, maybe as a musical. How about 'Mummy Mia!'?",0

4878," ""Chappaquiddick"" is reminder that while Camelot had its fair share of tragedy, none of the Kennedys were angels - but we already knew that, right?",0
81308," Cusack is uniquely suited to the role; a movie that really wanted to spook us would posit him as a happy, church-going family man. But until such time, we have Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom's fun take on Stephen King's short story of the same name.",1
48188, The basic message of Christianity -- love your brother -- is obscured under torrents of blood to the point of benumbing the audience.,0
78212," This film is based on an arcade video game that featured large-sized creatures knocking down buildings and running amok, but that basic idea has been swamped here by too many convoluted plot lines and extraneous characters.",0
31355, The kind of low-key family drama that never goes out of style.,1
52378," ""Machine Gun Preacher"" feels inspiring, but never inspired. Which is the difference between a great story and a great film.",1

512," The Irish are great storytellers, aren't they?",1
22860, It's the kind of compulsively watchable film you'll be helpless to resist when it shows up on cable TV.,1
57571, The film meanders in a nonsensical way and never reaches a satisfactory conclusion. It's got a Coen Brothers edge to it and will leave many viewers scratching their heads.,1

75321," Holy Motors is aggressively ""wild,"" a puzzle that tweaks the mind but doesn't nourish.",0
30223," The Lion King was made a mere 17 years ago, but seems from a different era now. Here was a ""kiddie"" flick that was big, grandiose and ambitious, a sprawling Shakespearean epic playing out on the African savannah.",1

29914, Hopes are dashed for the screenwriting contribution of Judd Apatow to elevate Adam Sandler as a poor man's Groucho Marx...,0
73763," The low budget hasn't prevented the filmmakers from taking care with details. The film's almost palpable: You feel the coldness of the blue, forbidding sky and smell the bristling dustiness of the harvest-ready wheat.",1
20476," Aside from Wes Anderson movies (most notably The Grand Budapest Hotel), I'd never seen a movie that took such care in composing each and every shot... ",1
8365," It's to Cranston's great credit that he's able to keep us watching this shallow, self-deceiving egotist. It's the film's fatal failing that we're never sure why.",0

45237," [Casal and Diggs'] talent and charisma are all but undeniable, and their ambition is impossible not to admire, but their execution is confused - fatally so, from a storytelling standpoint.",0
71255," Mistress America has enough bumps and bruises to keep it from being a superhero among comedy-drama movies, but it's not from a lack of trying by Gerwig. Her energy's enough to take a chance on this film.",1

49161, These characters have none of the passion and incipient mania that made Jerry Maguire -- or John Cusack's Lloyd Dobler in Crowe's debut Say Anything -- so engaging.,0
22002," The film, while preachy at times and overly simplistic at others, represents a necessary and often maddening look at an important issue.",1
19141," It's seriously terrible, and it'll teach everyone involved to read the script before they agree to make a film.",0
55531," On a sweltering July day in 1934, John Dillinger went to the movies and ended up dead. Now, 75 years later, the movies are killing him again.",0
75555," It subverts the focus of other '70s-set movies about charming crooks - of which ""Goodfellas"" is the standard-bearer - by emphasizing emotional mechanics over the ones used to perpetrate their crimes.",1

79385, I was periodically put off by a certain self-consciousness of delivery.,0

14485," The world and its choices are often cruel, but for all the devastations visited on the characters, Mr. Loznitsa is searching for the human good amid a human catastrophe.",1
22926," It awkwardly combines a working class family drama, a crime thriller and a science fiction yarn. Because the characters are so thin and hackneyed, it's impossible to get worked up over any of the plotlines.",0

32247, An ocean story without much depth. The fun shark tale is secondary to little fish story that won't make any waves. Expressive animation though and Ziggy Marley.,0

3452, So clich√©d it becomes the movie it is supposed to mock,0

75642, Grab your bucket of popcorn and check your thinking cap at the door. Godzilla is pure summer candy.,1
23668, Hairspray mixes aerosol-light social commentary with its affectionate Cinderella story and adds just enough wink-wink naughtiness to keep the earnest melodrama at bay.,1

54121," Pablo Larra√≠n's film, before a biopic, is a movie that plays with the dispute of who is its protagonist, whether the poet or the detective who pursues him. [Full review in Spanish]",1

3689, Pawel Pawlikowski shows great empathy toward the idea of illusions as a way of attaining emotional stability in even the most brutal terrain.,1
17190," 'Truth' works hard to make a profound statement about journalism in the vein of ""All the President's Men"" or ""The Insider,"" but it falls short mainly because it refuses to admit that the report was simply shoddy journalism.",1
38683," Unnecessarily prolonged, and a fussy addition to a film about Zamperini that already exists.",0
11689," The screenplay's clutchy banter (interspersed with arias of teary confession) feels distinctly Oprah, but Sayles extracts unexpected life from his wooden setups.",1

45250," The latest from Danish provocateur Lars von Trier (at least the first of its two halves) is challenging, explicit, and slyly humorous.",1
16648," Filmed in sumptuous colour, it's a deliciously amoral thriller with a devilishly attractive star.",1
34697," The movie sits in a murky place between appropriately weary historical drama and a more nimble action-Western hybrid, spurred by an outlaw's revenge",1
66256," It rises above its crowded narrative with an intense emotional core, taking a protagonist whose affliction had been played mostly for comedy, and exploring the emptiness and loneliness of her plight.",1
77396, Why aren't more 3D fireballs hurled at the audience? Anderson picked a weird moment in his career to show restraint.,0
50286, It's not funny that able-minded humans spend 150 minutes demonstrating to us what a LSD-fueled midlife crisis would look like.,0
25752, This is a movie in which everything feels vaguely familiar.,0

51713," The frenetic editing and shaky framing, a combination so familiar from MTV, become in Bertolucci's hands something greater than sham documentary.",1

59559," Edward Herrmann gets a very funny part as a train-happy millionaire; Cedric the Entertainer pulls the movie in another direction as a streety private detective. And as Clooney's worshipful, weepy best friend, Paul Adelstein nearly steals the movie.",1
30055, Occasionally overwrought and overwritten.,0

58424, This is a film of subtle beauty.,1

17749, A satire gleefully poking fun at the pretensions of the art world and liberal Swedes' earnest efforts to promote a dialogue on immigration and racism.,1
46143," ""Runner Runner"" is card dead, a middling, mediocre thriller that uses some poker lingo to try to wrangle the audience that got hooked the first time around.",0
77725," The dialogue strives for witty banter, but most laughs are unintentional.",0
57891, Guy Ritchie hit the big time with this flick but there is too much of the gangs of London and too little of the rumpled professor in the character of the famous detective.,1
7723," The course of ""Miracles From Heaven"" is never in doubt. When Garner as Beam intones in the opening voiceover questions of where miracles come from, the film's title has already stated the answer.",0
22261," Boasts the stock characters and situations, sentimentality, foreshadowing and melodrama of soap opera. Yet by cleverly blending these ingredients with those of an action caper, the pic presents a fresher appeal.",1

25157," It might not be as polished or meticulous as its contemporaries, but its motives, and the audacious effort to bring them to life, should be congratulated - the eventual DVD release is going to have one hell of a behind-the-scenes featurette.",1
44984, [R]eminiscent of the old vaudeville act where the guy would come out and start spinning plates on sticks.,0
83506, A surprisingly interesting picture.,1
47946, The overall experience of this film is a powerful one.,1
77120," What was once an enjoyably absurd, Avengers-like team-up of charismatic characters from disparate entries in the Furious-verse has now settled into generic, yet unnecessarily convoluted, action/adventure missions",0
14697," The movie is nonsense, but it does achieve a brazenly chic high style -- black-on-black, airborne, spasmodic.",1
34918, What most interests the creators of Race 2? Action-figure posturing.,0
77278," The jokes are few and far between, and the scenes inside the car lack the imagination and spontaneity a more comically attuned director would otherwise bring.",0
7200, The taboos between faith and homosexuality are canvassed in this sensitively directed and shocking expose about conversion therapy.,1
46671, Rio's chief problem is that it's a victim of its own generic success.,0
31166, Can be funny and endearing when you don't dwell on the black hole that is Jimmy Fallon.,0
68353," Bayona throws in lots of slow creaks and clangs, the art-house-horror equivalent of the jump moment, but none of them can rouse the movie from its terminal emotional torpor.",0
11461," Costner is as uneven as the storytelling itself, stone cold at moments, shimmeringly real in others.",0
62764," Merely competent yet still capable of cracking the Friday lineup and playing to big crowds. If this same movie were a baseball player, it couldn't make the softball team in a sandlot league.",0
5994," A movie of pure, undigested clich√©s, set to a generic pattern of jump scares and fake-outs.",0
6151," Charm City hits with the bracingly real force and honesty of Frederick Wiseman film. It's exceptionally well edited, with all three aspects of Baltimore life depicted in both positive and negative lights, but nothing here is being skewed.",1
61448, To call this film corny would be an insult to corn.,0
45770," Tasteless, trashy and totally over the top, Crank: High Voltage might also be one of the year's most inventive movies. Sometimes, nothing exceeds like excess.",1
20877," [Director] Schwimmer shows some skill by keeping the mood light and making no notable missteps, but he still comes away looking like someone trying, and failing, to play Judd Apatow, the reigning champion of realistic, emotional comedy.",0
15466," In this, the last performance he completed before his death, Ledger had a maniacal gusto inspired enough to suggest that he might have lived to be as audacious an actor as Marlon Brando, and maybe as great.",1
423," Director Charlie McDowell and screenwriter Justin Lader raise both smiles and pulses with their impressive feature debut, which never overplays its sneaky hand.",1
56489," An infectiously goofy film, but also deceptively smart about why we love comic book heroes and the amount of stupidity we're willing to accept within the genre.",1
9731, Soul Surfer is a heavy-handed plea for sympathy that doesn't do the real-life story justice.,0

47034, Big Momma's House seldom finds anything funny for Lawrence to do in drag.,0
30872, Moore's body is in better shape than her acting.,0
18107," A tender reminder that the heart sometimes still matters even if we now live in a technology-driven, Digital Age where machines lead and humans follow. ",1
72425," I'm glad Depp and Thompson were so close, and I'm sure Hunter would have been touched by the tribute. But that doesn't make it any fun for the rest of us to watch.",0

40152," Is a combo of thrills, juicy one-liners and fine star turns by Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.",1
72776, Great first act with top-notch performances by Ashley Bell and Pat Healy.,1
78292, It just felt like something was missing. nothing about this movie was very exciting. I'd say it was just a very average Sci-fi movie. ,0
72037, Sneaks up on you with an emotional punch.,1
75838," Fist Fight is a series of dick jokes that undermine the title's titular fight, never landing the knock-out blow that comedy fans are tuning in to see.",0
50475," As a formal exercise... Tangerine is nothing short of remarkable; as a portrait of people doing their best to be their best selves, it's as warm and vivid as the sunsets splashed across its narrow but expansive digital canvas.",1
45584," Whereas the more grounded scenes of Death Note anchor a startlingly bloody fantasy of power run amok, the scenes that fixate on super powers and code-busting seldom manage to rise above the realm of serviceable YA fiction.",0
24382," Rumored to be the most expensive comedy ever made, the laughs come at a high price in Evan Almighty, as much as $50 million per snicker.",0
32816, Gloria Trevi's life is portrayed in a capable film that's able to shed new light on a very known subject. [Full review in Spanish],1
35467, Nani is the only saving grace in Devadas. The actor gets into the skin of the character and gives his best to the make the lousy writing tolerable.,0

82501," I wish I could tell you Miss Peregrine is good, except it isn't. It's not bad, either. It is, you might say, a movie that exists.",0
42547," For Snyder, it's among his better films, even though it doesn't offer a single memorable image or idea.",0
40947, Letters to Juliet represents an interesting paradox: it is a movie that is very nearly perfect without being especially good.,0
78561, The love is there; what's missing is the care.,0
32508," There have also been digital restorations and improvements to the original film's negative and sound mix, but the best thing about this rerelease is simply the opportunity to see the awesome Alien in theatres again.",1
2449," Sommers showers us with noise and color, but the film rarely generates much in the way of real excitement. There's a freeze-dried feel to much of the movie...",0
38581, This silly film leaves an unpalatable aftertaste.,0
54118," While Reeves brings more depth to his character than the script warrants, the film overall lacks compelling characters and winds up depressing instead of profound.",0
54505," A blockbuster that satisfies both the die-hard aficionado and the newcomer to the Terminator brand, with just the right mix of action and self-aware humor to overcome the film's emotional deficiencies.",1
20713," As a longtime detester of the MCU machine, I must admit that it brought me some joy.",0
61802, Sorcerer's Stone is that rare effort that successfully breathes cinematic life into a children's classic.,1
74138," While it fails to make a compelling argument for terrorism, it is a compelling story nonetheless.",1
46596," Refusing insincerity, demanding attention, and committed to the art of performance, Stritch's life seems tailor-made for a documentary.",1
36358," Think of it as a really, really, little gem.",1
36563," It all falls apart in the end, as Francois Ozon films sometimes do, but as usual the middle section is tops.",1
42030," Despite the very predictable way the movie moves along, the message here is simple, well-known and comfortingly reassuring -- that if someone loves you, they will do so because of who you really are on the inside.",1
22492, There's a reason this clunker is being buried at the end of August and wasn't screened for most critics -- it shouldn't screen for most audiences either.,0

43159, more one liners than schwarzenegger could dream off,0
51684," The Men Who Stare at Goats doesn't stay with you long, but it's good fun while it lasts.",1
60621," A string of shameless sales pitches sans the rudiments of a major motion picture. Next time, how about including an ending if you're going to ask us to sit through two hours of commercials?",0
67119, It's not deep: it's a wispy-light meringue of a romantic spy-versus-spy comedy. But it is smart. It expects that you're keeping up with the tricks it's trying to pull on you.,1
75714," Even if you smirk at the plot conceit of mind-linked humans inside skyscraping robots fighting blockbuster sea beasts, the technical prowess on display can't help but impress.",1
38926, The premise - Mean Girls with demonic possession and a feminist subtext - is promising. But the film fails to deliver either laughs or scares in sufficient numbers.,0
30228," The rambunctious Iron Man 3 is a briskly paced thrill ride until about 90 minutes in, when the excitement wanes. A few late-breaking surprises re-invigorate the tale, however.",1
2502," ... it all feels a little bit like a sporting episode of Upstairs, Downstairs and comes off as overly twee to really compel.",0
30529," Hynes, as ever, oozes resilience and honesty. As well as showing off a mean right hook, she has crafted a moving tribute to shattered middle age.",1
82740," As the lost piece of an intricate puzzle, Rogue One satisfyingly presses into its rightful place in the series' universe. Filling in that blank space might never have seemed necessary, but, once you've seen it, there's no denying the richness added.",1
77616," Inspired by a true story set in 1996, this spiritual meditation on conscience, religion, and values is intriguing, haunting and relevant in todaly's world of turbulent politics of religion; it should be a frontrunner for the 2010 foreign-lingo Oscar. ",1
44018," The film is beautifully shot, courtesy of John Seale's gorgeous cinematography, and the special effects are extremely impressive, especially during the exciting finale.",1
55782," Befitting two of the co-authors of This is Spinal Tap, Guest and Michael McKean, The Big Picture displays a keen eye for the silliness of film biz customs, lingo and attitudes.",1
80263," Ang Lee has created a truly adult adventure, not because the material is salacious or violent, but because it deals with complex themes of spirituality and self-discovery in the guise of an accessible and engrossing fantasy.",1
19561," Scenes end up going nowhere: gritty reality sometimes gives way to farcical silliness, and Gainsbourg is not well cast in this rather gooey role.",0
16516," For me the excitement waned as the film got into the last stages of its 142-minute run time, but until then it fulfills the requirements of an arthouse roller-coaster ride.",1
25271," Oldboy is a delirious, confronting ride, a movie full of visceral shocks and aesthetic pleasures: it has an explosive immediacy and a persistent afterlife, a lingering impact that is hard to shake.",1
67043, The screenplay lets off the accelerator and runs into a few narrative dead ends.,0
25833," Although the analysis is far from deep, Mock's film succeeds as an above-average introduction to the playwright, especially to an audience unfamiliar with his work.",1
67085, Ice Age posits a heretofore unfathomable question: Is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions?,0
16774, The finest performance yet from Logan Lerman.,1
13308," It's the ultimate in cinematic channel-surfing. ... As a result, this jumbled comedy-drama develops a serious (and we do mean serious) multiple-personality problem. ",0
76531," Sin Nombre is a brutal, dark film that is one of the most moving and memorable that I've seen in a long time",1
54222," Boasts a few pleasingly poetic flourishes, but it suffers from some common first-time director flaws, notably a listless narrative, thinly developed characters and a relentlessly somber mood.",0
632," Diaz lets her wardrobe and bad attitude do the work for her, but she's left high and dry at the end of the film when it abruptly tries to redeem Elizabeth's bad behavior.",0
74943," At every turn, the filmmakers go for clutter and tumult where simplicity would do -- and Adamson, to put it kindly, isn't the fleetest of action directors.",0
59582," Funny Cow may prove as hard to embrace as its spiky subject, but Peake's performance and Hawley's music help to carry us across the threshold.",1
46669," Handsomely shot by Damian Garcia in full-frame black-and-white, G√ºeros is at times both painfully arty and arbitrarily plotted.",0
41042," A film that will possibly become the last hero of a dying genre that everybody will be talking about, at least for a few years. [Full review in Spanish]",1
58976," ""MDMA""... doesn't fully communicate the context of Angie's experience priors to the film, keeping us removed from the character and the movie as a whole.",0
10762," Another Day In Paradise is so generally overwrought that the willing suspension of disbelief is not really an option. On the other hand, you may find yourself caring about the characters.",1
68561, It's vivid and uncompromising at best. And at worst? You might admire it just slightly more than you enjoy it.,1
81051, I suspect this might be one of the times when life surpasses art.,0
36717, Spread never generates enough drama to make audiences care about Kutcher's lackadaisical boy toy and the film's laughs are too few for it to succeed as an Ashton Kutcher comedy.,0
39539," For those who want to surrender to a good time, let these well-drawn fellas and Soderbergh's attention to detail entertain you.",1
3799, Downey is a brilliant actor who somehow manages to portray Tony Stark as traumatised without losing the character's laidback and comedic quality.,1
31813," Attempts to be a slow burn thriller building to a climactic shoot-out are more 'Back to the Future III' than 'High Noon,' but smaller character moments are deeply, genuinely felt by the actors. ",0
3563, Painfully obvious and cliched.,0
26979," Although it's a film that's constructed around wish-fulfilment gone awry and a series of madcap chases, Shorts also has a heart. Rodriguez's best kids film yet.",1
3377," As always, the biggest screams emanating from the audience come when Lautner bares his chest.",0
37816," I found myself occasionally enthralled, mainly due to Polanski's haunted presence coming through, even in the form of an absent ghost.",1
5215," It's one of those movies that's just so enjoyable, you're disappointed when it ends.",1
45175, It's a mildly poignant generation-gap story.,1
59580," For what is supposed to be a poignant love story, The Other Sister fails to show much spark.",0
56004," The film is an illustration of Van Sant's virtuosity, as well as a textbook example of cinema's potential to place us squarely in the emotional landscape of another human being.",1
6382," Strangely, Clooney's movie lacks the tightening tension the story intends to achieve.",0
38376," Movies shouldn't provide moral instruction but the best incorporate competing philosophies. Unfortunately, there is no one Scorsese can bring himself to be quite as interested in as Belfort.",0
11275," Haley offers a darker, meaner take on the iconic character.",0
7340," rays of sunshine don't make the dark and nightmarish fantasy go away, and it might not be such a fun time for sensitive teens and tots in the theatre",0
72794," A beautiful, unassuming, rewarding ache of a movie.",1
24252, The problem is that all the stuff involving Canet and his fumblings is pretty awful and just grows increasingly intolerable as the film goes on.,0
22142, Bill and Ted meet Dawn of the Dead.,0
29207, Strangest thing is: It's not as irritating as you might think.,1
78109," Finally, the race is on. The battle for Best Picture begins with Martin Scorsese's The Departed, an outstanding return to form that will be nominated across the board in several major categories.",1
37831," A fascinatingly complex, humanizing portrait that faces controversy head-on.",1
24952," Gerontophilia is rather reminiscent of a student film, and I don't mean that it has the fire of youth. It is restrained by a rank amateurism that borders on embarrassing.",0
68891, A fun and particular reflection about art. Opera in this case. [Full review in Spanish],1
65653, Peter Strickland's wryly subversive S&M fantasy is everything that Fifty Shades of Grey isn't.,1
64522," At its best, the film gets by on its striking imagery, from a panorama of sickening human decadence to a mid-movie retelling of the creation story that might make Terrence Malick weep.",1
55555," If only Morel and Besson would have committed to satirizing, instead of merely exploiting, this superficially cool, destructively cold archetype of American firepower, they could've had more than multiplex filler.",0
67204," A heist movie that's breathtakingly silly while maintaining an impressively serious level of self-belief, this is a disarmingly entertaining ride. There's no one called Den, though, which is a missed opportunity. ",1
5779, It's basically Saw for kids.,0
27859," In Bruges is a weird mix of bloody violence and situational comedy that occasionally provides a sombre meditation on mortality, and even functions as a picturesque travelogue to boot. And it works.",1
39152," It's spirited, totally exploitative, entirely forgettable high body count slasher movie fun, and it sure ain't pretending to be quality cinema.",0
15517, Strong performances can't overcome the drama's familiarity.,0
7783, Features an exceedingly dapper Richard Gere in a series of nice suits and handsome close-ups that serve no purpose other than to remind us how exceedingly dapper Richard Gere looks in nice suits and handsome close-ups.,0
30559," The story ends when the protagonists are finally able to look to the future without qualms, despite their past and despite, also, themselves. [Full review in Spanish]",1
29937," Another attempt at a charming working-class English comedy in the vein of The Full Monty, this one unfortunately isn't very funny. Finding Your Feet is too maudlin and too long; even the choppy dancing scenes fail to satisfy. ",0
37496, A bold attempt to pimp a Metallica concert film falls short of initial promise.,0
70120," This movie should have made me afraid to go to sleep, but in fact I couldn't wait.",0
32372," While acknowledging some missteps (such as jumping into a strenuous project too soon after surgery), Saffire and Schlesinger exhibit Whelan's grace in dance and in life.",1
81820, This probably wouldn't have been such a thought-provoking film if it hadn't been based on a true story.,1
72871," The shortcuts are maddening, but so is Spread as a whole. Just because the lead character is an insipid, mean-spirited waste of time doesn't mean the movie has to follow suit.",0
8514," The film's emotional undercurrent is both tender and insistent. We are as our fathers sculpted us, says ""The Meyerowitz Stories,"" and we spend a lifetime learning to move and breathe on our own.",1
22915," More in line with About Schmidt than Sideways, Alexander Payne's latest is a warm and witty look at the relationship between fathers and sons...",1
44417, In the end it's hopelessly sappy stuff.,0
36106," Soul Power turns out to be an unusually resonant time capsule, one that weaves together theatrics, musicianship, cosmopolitanism and sharp political critique in a vibrant look-back that's at once celebratory and wistful.",1
77668," [Not] played for cynical misanthropic laughs or as miserable tragedy, but...[in] an honest treatment devoid of the usual rush to judgment.",1
57002," Each relationship is deftly, brilliantly sketched and the relationship snapshots are satisfyingly complex",1
53890, Rarely does a film employ the frame so fully and serve up images of such breathtaking scale as in The Fall.,1
77566, Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz continue to do their best to offset the summer's more infantile impulses in this fine adaptation of Philip Roth's novel.,1
43865," The effects work here doesn't break any incredible new ground or shatter any records, and yet this is one of the most visually impressive movies I have ever seen.",1
16398, ...tough-minded science fiction rooted in sociopolitical realities that set it apart from almost every other CGI-ed blockbuster.,1
1424," It's unlikely Gilliam's own, undeniably brilliant career will be revitalised by this rambling, undisciplined and indulgent piece of work.",0
42061," James Graham's centering of Cummings in the narrative attempts to present him as more of an anti-hero than a straightforward antagonist, and that's where the show didn't quite land.",0
30910, It's the kind of feast that could give you food poisoning.,0
27001," Some of the lines are pretty clever, but you need to have a very keen and sticky tolerance for dogs making goo-goo eyes.",0
38341," Though there are several truly funny moments in Big Daddy, they're all included in the trailer, so if you've seen it, that's all you need.",0
16935," It's gleefully immature. It revels in destruction. And it made me laugh a lot, like it always does.",1
68080," Unpredictable and mildly engaging with decent performances, but suffers from an uneven balance of dark comedy, drama and satire with too much awkwardness and not enough bite.",0
8428," Unfortunately the movie loses this supernatural vibe in the second half, settling into a rather literal-minded revenge tale, though like much Argentinian art cinema it makes effective and poetic use of the natural settings.",0
83290," An ambitious, great, and flawed film ... [it] reminds us that this man never quit loving us, never quit forgiving his enemies, even as they tore him to shreds. ",1
48213," It's glossy and at times goofily funny, mostly thanks to Johnson's subtle comic skills, but the novelty of this messy relationship is really beginning to wear off.",0
34182," Although the terrorist attack is effectively staged, The 15:17 To Paris fails to spin a remarkable film out of a remarkable act of heroism.",0
20292, Excruciating. That's how it felt to sit through the sequel to a film which wasn't good to begin with. This is a movie about magic that has none of its own.,0
1260, Directed with no mystery or imagination...,0
54364, An insulting and dehumanizing nightmare that doubles as a truly bizarre look into the director's own creative process.,0
33507," Hogancamp and ""Marwencol"" trusted the viewer to see the story in still images; ""Welcome to Marwen"" doesn't believe the audience can make the same leap.",0
72974," The most important message of [ How to Train Your Dragon] is from DreamWorks to their rivals Pixar. It simply reads, ""We're baaaack.""",1
47338," A rather unsettling mix of light and dark, which robs it of power and causes it to become muddled.",0
48799, Branagh's Sleuth delivers a preening surface that's glossy and coldly attractive but we don't care a whit about the characters or what happens to them.,0
49739," It's by no means a must-see, but it is definitely worth the watch.",1
43957," While the Carell/Fey pairing looks like a winner on paper, Date Night somehow just isn't that funny.",0
82601," The original movie's climax, an endearingly corny homily about the necessity of peace, has been replaced by a pointless tsunami of digital effects.",0
2114," Warner Bros, we got a problem.",0
13099," Some of their jokes work, but most fail miserably and in the end, Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny.",0
28974," The film devolves into the cozily predictable world of TV legal dramas, abandoning the moral uncertainty of its opening scenes...",0
28256," Although it -- like others -- is misguided in its sympathies for a youthful crook, this crime-and-compassion melodrama has the virtues of vigor and restraint.",1
54276," There is a clear clarity to every performance from start to finish, from Roberts all the way down. ",1
5303," It sounds like a formula slasher film, but it's actually done well.",1
65107, A subtle work acted with restraint illustrating a woman's conflict between duty and desire.,1
4154," A busy, over-produced special effects extravaganza that tries to be both funny and mildly scary but manages to be neither.",0
27303," When City of Tiny Lights doesn't try too hard it's brilliant, it's the moments it strains itself to make a point that something is lost. ",1
43297," The gothic horror setting is delectable, but this is far from the Holy Grail of spin-offs. Could we not have had Sister Act 3 instead?",0
31993," If you're looking for an intense, character-driven movie, Revolutionary Road delivers big time.",1
23785," Handsomely shot and beautifully constructed, Brooklyn is a truly great American story.",1
28863," A huge hit in Russia, this horror movie is a testament to how desperate for entertainment they must be over there.",0
31605," Deriving inspiration from a certain famed Arthur Miller play and reframing it for the era of rampant, media-invoked Satanic Panic fears, ""Regression"" provocatively blankets its elegiac mystery in a malignant pall of diabolical foreboding.",1
33903," This is a profoundly, intensely, extravagantly personal film.",1
61198," Wilson's film is beautifully shot, melancholy and foreboding, and more terrifying for what you know is coming rather than what you are seeing.",1
56296," This is a mature and thoughtful drama that absorbs the viewer into the world of the family, and leaves you as emotionally bruised and drained as the characters themselves.",1
37498, A scrappy documentary on the increasingly currency-focused machinations of the art world.,1
65342," Love and Other Drugs is successful in small doses, but the full regimen needed more testing.",0
57273, First Man is why we go to the movies.,1
63705, Second-time director Lee Daniels creates a must-see portrait of life's underprivileged which is utterly compelling.,1
62579," The Little Hours is a very silly idea that works perfectly, reinterpreting a story from Boccaccio's magnum opus as a goofy, cheerfully vulgar comedy performed by a fantastic cast of American goofballs.",1
47021, Captain Marvel is a must-see superhero film. It pushes all the right buttons in bringing the audience to the edge of their seat and rooting for the newest and first standalone female superhero film in the MCU.,1
81872," Inside this failed picture there's a sicker, darker, more truthful one crying to get out.",0
79502," It has no idea whatsoever what tone it wants to adopt towards its subject matter, and even less towards the character of Philomena.",0
37501, The contradictions of adolescence have rarely been conveyed with such authenticity and force.,1
6095," May be the nastiest, cruelest fun you can have without actually having to study law or gird leather products.",1
54062," Mr. Zicherman needs a better crew, some time with the Criterion Collection and a fresher story, one perhaps not plucked from his own life.",0
76047," Half the Picture, Amy Adrion's no-frills documentary, offers a diligent, straightforward overview of the innumerable obstacles facing today's female directors, both aspiring and accomplished.",1
33838," It is Ejiofor - bewildered, sorely tested, morally towering - whose staggered dignity anchors the film.",1
5771, Perhaps the filmmakers were too deeply in thrall to their subject to get the proper distance to create a dramatic story. What we get instead is an emotional and beautiful tribute.,1
8700," Coming right now, the movie is a profoundly bittersweet experience. Mostly, though, it's sweet.",1
68568," The voyage features some spectacularly exciting encounters with wildlife, difficult negotiations among the men and one stunning vista after another of sunny, blue gorgeousness.",1
61511," It's impossible to discern the relevance of this kind of film-making, which is doubtless why nobody (including Antonioni) practises it any more.",0
35427, Con thriller ensemble is cozy and cute -- and perhaps a little too content with how familiar it is.,0
50237, Mary-Kate and Ashley sprint through Manhattan on the run from a truant officer and a limo driver in this crisp and professional teenage caper comedy.,0
83412, Bong presents his characterizations with a blend of black humor and pathos ... He also happens to write (along with co-writer Park Eun-kyo) one heck of a narrative.,1
76127," Despite some scenes that have the feel of an acting or writing workshop, these are believable, complex characters. Their story has a full measure of Judd Apatow raunch, with a dash of Swingers emotional sweetness.",1
1197," [Spike Lee] doesn't always hit his target (like with ""Bamboozled""), but he does with ""25th Hour.""",1
76209, It's disappointing that a movie made by women and starring some of the best working actresses tackling a large subject couldn't add more to the conversation.,0

50276," A lovely addition to Ken Loach's cinema of working-class heroes, this true story of Irish agitator James Gralton is intelligent, gorgeously shot, and makes the heart sing.",1
22599," A bold attempt to convey a complex situation that captures the anger and tensions of early-20th century Ireland, but falls strangely short on human drama.",1
39111," A quiet yet resolute portrait of bravery and resilience in the face of unconscionable bigotry, and distressingly moving. Specific yet universal, and wonderfully human.",1
83963, Wraps a detective thriller and a paranoid Orwellian future into a metaphor for the submissive act of viewing film.,1
10992," Unmistakably indifferent to everything she's forced to chaperon, Hardwicke's direction is mostly lazy , and tremendously derivative.",0

2685, Forget about sex or adultery -- there isn't enough life in Last Night.,0
71065," This is a fact-based film that treads no new survival-drama ground, but it's well made, gruelling and watchable.",1
70164," Bynes gives it the old college try, though, in a watered-down combination of Legally Blonde and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.",0
27404, I Feel Pretty isn't just a regression from Inside Amy Schumer; it's a less shrewd treatment of almost identical themes.,0
69514," The source material is Anne Marie du Preez Bezdrob's biography, and the period detail is spot on. Yet Winnie: the movie opts to wear its heart openly on its sleeve, and play it absurdly safe.",0

78379," Isabelle Huppert is an acting force to be reckoned with every time I see her. Here, as Elle, she may be diminutive in stature but her force of will cannot be matched.",1
48574," I need jokes. Something more than a situation recycling the situation in the first one. I'd like filmmakers who, worldwide grosses aside, show more of an interest in filming visual comedy -- gross-out, violent, action-based, whatever -- with some finesse.",0
67662, ...a historical drama that's both handsome and alive.,1

12783," Incoherent, pretentious and boring, Aronofsky's film appears as terminally stricken as its female lead. While a re-edit is unlikely to help, it may be better served on DVD, where its jigsaw-like structure can be more fully appreciated.",0
44352," Solidly watchable, even if the characters remain frustratingly unknowable.",1
80376," It's a well-crafted, suspenseful effort that at least tries to appear intelligent and aware.",1

55062," ... a serious and well-made film that does the only moral thing a movie can do when it attempts to confront great evil - it nips off a human-size chunk and doesn't flinch when the horror turns and bares its bloody, brazen maw.",1
65720," The Hidden World doesn't really stop giving you lovely things to gawk at. But as an act of storytelling, it's curiously perfunctory, never rising to the level of effort and care put into creating its cornucopia of visual pleasures.",0
52210," While the film has its bright moments, The Nanny Diaries never effectively gets a good read on the subject.",0
15871," Kung Fu Panda 3 actually feels like part of the story, like it has a good reason to exist on its own, aside from just being an investment for a movie company. ",1

65880, There's no point in expecting to find sense in this schmaltzy story.,0
77653," Cumberbatch, rocking white, stringy locks and some alien-like dance moves, does a fine 'SNL' impersonation. But he's sinister, not ambiguous - a loathsome hypocrite bound to inspire hit pieces like this.",0
46328," With a true story that's almost hard to believe, this inspiring biographical drama is made with attention to detail and a remarkable resistance to sentiment.",1
62730," If the first half of Cam is pleasantly episodic and purringly tense, the latter half-in which Alice searches for her hacker-is clever, inventive, and wonderfully evocative.",1
22200," Crash is difficult to watch because of the moral chaos it portrays, but it is best film I have seen in a long time. ",1
22039," The film never quite manages to match the fun, humor and creativity of its opening moments, although the introduction of plenty of charm and warmth mostly make up for the weakening of the funny stuff.(Full Content Review for Parents also available)",1
75009," Grudge Match yells a lot and maniacally yanks at the heartstrings like a buzzard ripping out soft tissue, but even the in-ring battle choreography is abysmal. It's all pretty depressing, to be truthful.",0
15152," Although the sci-fi trappings of Downsizing make it seem like a big departure from Payne's previous work - The Descendants, Sideways, About Schmidt - it is the same in important ways.",1

55526," Oliver will remind you more than a little of Max Fischer in ""Rushmore,"" not to mention Holden Caulfield and every bright, alienated teenage boy in pop culture. ",1
7333," The film celebrates the NYPL as a vital service for the city and local branch-catering neighborhoods as a space for education, culture, and community. ",1
11306," The underwritten script fails to develop its premise adequately, shifts gears mechanically and comes too easily to a convenient finale.",0
69748, Indie horror doesn't get much more stylish or creepy than The Devil's Candy.,1
20576," While the film might not be for everyone, it offers a sensitive and visually appealing look at the trials that a transgender person often has to face in the world.",1
82299, Somewhat dissuasive because of its uneven dramatic intensity. [Full Review in Spanish] ,0
7126," It's ""The Breakfast Club"" meets ""Wedding Crashers,"" without the depth of the former or the comedic spunkiness of the latter.",0

55133," An incisive critique that demonstrates Lee's ability to relate events from more than forty years ago, with America's current social state. [Full review in Spanish]",1
11980," This feature is exceptionally good at pulling its punches, leaving discouraged viewers to fantasize about a more satisfying picture poured from the same filmmaking ingredients.",0
75855," As always it's hard to feel too much sympathy for someone who assumes the rules (or in this case rule, singular) don't apply to them. But at least grief-stricken desperation is a fairly solid excuse.",0
46071, It's a strange variety of entertainment that hooks you throughout and then leaves you nothing but glad that it's over.,0
30004, Southside with You is unmistakably worthy of a second date.,1
23113," It's thoughtful, provocative, liberating and fun.",1
59312," American Sniper isn't the war movie this country needs. But it is, to borrow a phrase, the war movie this country deserves. And for that reason I wept.",0
54859," The pace of the film is fast and it generates a lot of tension. The acting is solid, led by Brosnan, who handles this role with aplomb, along with veteran actor Bill Smitrovich (""Ted"") who plays CIA section chief Hanley.",1
79276," It's a thoroughly enjoyable three- or four-gimmick comedy, highlighted by a whorish dimwit pop star played by Anna Faris.",1
60172," This Tarzan has an untamed beauty, a savagery that's as thrilling as it is dangerous...",1
53604," But what really makes One Night Only work is the chemistry between Kwok and Yang, because, despite the gangsters and guns and the prostitute-with-a-heart-of-gold cliche, it's a surprisingly effective and moving love story.",1

46349, Anyone over the age of nine should avoid. Strenuously. ,0

6451," Make sure to see the long version (167 minutes) of Tarkovsky's provocative sci-fi, one of the best of its genre",1
38851," features amazing production design and a fascinating story at first, the film does eventually fall apart at the end.",1
51213," The closest thing to the grotesque incestuous f***pile that defines the deeper recesses of modern ""fanfic"" culture ever to grace a movie screen: a Doctor Who meets Pokemon mash-up rewritten into a tangential Harry Potter prequel.",0
23023," ...so convoluted, idiotic and preachy that it plays like M. Night Shyamalan adapting the Left Behind books. Only dopier.",0
31511, The film is visualized in such a straightforward manner that it feels as if it could have been made in 1950. There's not a moment of freshly imaginative or unconventional footage. ,0

70483, like nothing so much as a William Asher beach blanket bomb-o,0
33987, It's like this: The book is sensational. The movie is sensationalistic. Both are enjoyable. The book is better.,1
6312," ""The Last Face"" is the worst kind of good-intentioned noble failure, one that muddles its message because it tries too hard to tell it.",0
47979," There are constant twists and turns, eventually straining credulity, but there's also -- and typically for The Coens -- a salutary quorum of absurdist dialogue, black humour and wryly memorable exchanges.",1
71371," ...at almost three hours this convoluted film telling six separate tales is too long and, in the end, too preachy. I felt like I should get a T-shirt that said, ""I survived Cloud Atlas."" ",1
49724," The film becomes unintentionally funny when he falls for another hustler (Margarita Levieva) with even less conscience, their grand passion leading to ludicrous behavior and soap-opera dialogue.",0
28047," The Dilemma marks the latest step in Ron Howard's attempt to recapture his past glory as a populist filmmaker, and apparently that involves making a terrible Vince Vaughn comedy.",0
58290," The story drifts aimlessly toward its foregone conclusion, hitting a few interesting notes along the way but never gelling into a coherent narrative.",0
31737, This is one grubby little movie. But the shabbiest aspect of the whole enterprise is that the script can't even fully embrace its truly sordid nature.,0
662, [A] grand and worthy sequel that packs an emotional wallop and brilliant visuals.,1

82898," Though not as funny as its 2012 predecessor, ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" it does offer some nice-looking peeks into its animated cyber world. (And, oh, by the way, why aren't they calling it ""Ralph Wrecks the Internet""?)",1
41413," In form, it's no wham-bam VFX sizzle reel replete with sputtering, ejaculatory climaxes. It's the magnificently sustained equivalent of Ravel's ""Bolero,"" with nuclear warheads in place of timpani rolls.",1
12064," Immensely entertaining, Coriolanus is chock-full o' gore and the contemporary trappings of a man and a land divided, both from without and from within.",1
72321," Wyler's direction is heavyhanded (imagine what Lubitsch or Capra would have done with the romantic tale), but the actors (Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, and Eddie Albert) are charming and on-location shoot in Rome is major benefit even if the film is b/w.",1

75877, This deeply questionable movie presents itself as a documentary. Actually it is hardly more than an exploitative gangsta rap video about the worst slums of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. Leth's movie is politically and morally illiterate.,0
37319," Enjoyable whizz through a chapter of musical history, with a terrific soundtrack and great performances across the board.",1
24447," The Beguiled is clever, surprising and less aggressive than your average wartime tale, and that seems appropriate for a story of survival told with a woman's touch.",1

32732," Overall, though, this is dismal fare.",0
35020," The movie doesn't deepen or expand the tale's themes as masterfully as The Empire Strikes Back added to Star Wars' mystique. But as a stirring story of unsullied heroism, it's a winner, and as an action epic, it features superb battle sequences.",1
33995, Grease has energy and a total commitment to pleasing its audience.,1
77125," People don't go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In ""The Longest Ride,"" authenticity is in short supply.",0

5431," When the film suggests that wind farms atop the mountains are the answer while backing higher taxes on such energy, which is more expensive than coal in the first place, it demonstrates its lack of interest in market reality.",0
53652, This is a timely and most welcome interpretation of an intriguing period.,1
61261," Hollywood is always making family comedies, but they are rarely about real families: relations who are as difficult as they are wonderful, people who both love and irritate the heck out of each other. Families like The Family Stone.",1
1199, Director Roland Emmerich is the ultimate spectacle over substance filmmaker. He actually makes Michael Bay look like Stanley Kubrick by comparison.,0
83950," The romance is contrived; the sexual jokes rarely land; and the cameos seem more for show than for storytelling. That's not to say that I didn't laugh, or enjoy it, but it's horribly predictable, and about as frequently tasteless as it is charming",0
38156, Should be immediately screened in film schools across the world as a shining example of everything that is wrong with the American studio system and the increasingly dreadful junk it produces.,0

51944," Oh, that ""RED"" was the giddy romp it might have been, it promises to be or it thinks it is. ",1
43233," The only reasons to see this structurally messy, poorly directed flick are the spectacular effects, which overwhelm the plot, and the charismatic performance of soon to be Hollywood star Aussie Sam Worthington who steals every scene he is in.",0

9281, The million-dollar cast doesn't make the vulgar penny-ante jokes any funnier.,0

12847," Stylized, set-designed to the last hair wisp, the film is a mixture of bold devices with delicate understatement that leave a remarkable aftereffect.",1
78853," It ain't big, it ain't clever, but it is... quite funny.",1
36149," Peter Rabbit is better as a straight comedy than an adaptation of Beatrix Potter's beloved books. It's full of laughs, but never captures its source's warmth.",1

12621," Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow are the co-directors of De Palma, a scrumptious documentary about the creator of Carrie and Scarface.",1

61514," The big problem with Danny Collins is Danny Collins, a weird hybrid of late Rod Stewart, mid-period Neil Diamond, and, I don't know, a less-sexual Tom Jones? Rick Nelson in reverse? The math doesn't quite make it.",0
52039," The real disappointment is that the film does not transport an audience to another world, as 300 did. Nor does the third-rate Chandler-esque narration by Rorschach help.",0
83291, The screenplay ... goes about the expected route in regards to the protagonists' superiors ... but it's in the central characters' actions that the film truly finds its edge.,1
3300," I am overwhelmed by the intensity of theme, and underwhelmed by the sophomoric content thereof, and so I end up in the middle, sort of whelm-neutral.",0

69022," The back-and-forth goes on and on, increasingly impenetrable. Talk. Poke. Provoke. Repeat.",0

5977," The performances are wry and believable with a fun turn by the Phantasm himself, Angus Scrimm.",1

35952, ... simply the vehicle for the delivery of complex and colorful action sequences. [Full review in Spanish],1
19536, Here's hoping Moana opens the floodgates for more adventures with both girls and boys at the helm,1

36544," The Fault In Our Stars could indeed become this generation's Love Story -- mildly implausible, but genuinely moving.",1
23962," If not a home run, then at least a solid base hit.",1
1285," [Dujardin] has a goofy and endearing smile, and somehow manages to combine Sean Connery's suave appeal with the pomposity and incompetence of Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau.",1
48182, This insane masterpiece shows the self-destructive properties of myth making and how they overlap with the downfall of a community damned from the beginning of time. ,1
79955, Fast-paced escapism that should satisfy even the most loyal of Bourne supporters.,1
42335," ... sometimes, method acting is its own worst enemy. Theron is very, very good ... but many close-ups seem almost calculated to keep reminding us of just how extraordinarily her appearance has been changed.",1
66232," As with the first film, the characters and their interactions again provide all the high points, with the cluttered storyline and routine action sequences jockeying for place position.",1
8898," An intended tour de force, it is strangely unable to engage the emotions. In the end it amounts to an overweight movie that delivers less than its clever director, David Fincher, seems to think.",0
41804," Alita: Battle Angel is an engaging piece of thoroughly computer-generated action pop, hokey and amiable and filled with enough set pieces to never drag.",1
6877," The film should be commended for updating the story so well, and for allowing a new generation (who may not be interested in the 1984 original, but might love Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan) to appreciate the timeless story.",1
78369," With the best lead performance of the year, a few great supporting ones, excellent music, and completely genuine characters freed of an ounce of melodrama, Crazy Heart is one of the best dramas of 2009.",1

50007," Unlike the two-dimensional pages of a comic book, and unlike it's two-dimensional Marvel Comics movie character cousins, Ant-Man is three-dimensional fun. ",1
26311," If you're going to make a movie about one of the greatest singer/lyricists of all time but you can't get the rights to their story or any of their music, don't even bother.",0
5052," There's exactly one Great Scene . . and the journey to get there is long, sedate and rather unspectacular considering the tantalizing story. ",0
5719, Of all the things in Insurgent-the second installment of the YA sci-fi action Divergent series-the lack of concern for Chicago winter is the most unbelievable.,0
47853," A quite remarkable story being told by one of the industry's most reliable, and resourceful storytellers.",1
8883," This carefully respectful, sensitively acted biopic sands all the edges off Hank Williams's story to create a frustratingly inert portrait.",0
5058," [A] pleasant film, which sings the praises of nonconformity.",1
55952," Entertaining in its grand flourishes but spottier when it comes to character work and thematic coherence, the film boasts a slightly darker and more mystical air than its peers, accentuated by some of the most arresting set pieces in the MCU canon.",1
83479, The screwiness feels patterned and arbitrary. There's little Upside here.,0
22397, You might want to take along your smartphone to keep yourself entertained.,0
5026," Witherspoon and Vergara have charisma to spare and the potential for an oil-and-water chemistry that could have worked, but director Anne Fletcher didn't guide them anywhere and writers David Feeney and John Quiantance gave them nothing to work with.",0
79425," A triumph of pure cinema and wonderful visual storytelling from Chandor, who must now be considered the real deal, while Redford is sublime in what could well be the performance of his career.",1
65119," Glass is very mixed bag: compelling when it's good, but numbing and absurd when it's bad.",0
17411," Nevertheless, the HBO special - in which Silverman plays to a 39-seat room, the most intimate of standup settings - offers a pretty good metaphor for her career, opting for the intimacy of a side room instead of the main stage.",0
64721, 'Bourne' again? I don't think so.,0
28510, Hart and Johnson's off-the-scale comic chemistry ensures you'll spend the entire movie alternating between laughing out loud and grinning like an idiot. ,1
78913," Part of the response comes from the excitement of discovery: an unknown writer-director making his feature debut, and creating a gritty crime story (with strong emotional currents) set against an unlikely backdrop.",1
7266," Nixon is infinitely more complex than George W. Bush, which is probably why this one slice of his life is more intriguing than ""W,"" which covers decades.",1
29392," Intoxicating, ferocious, and righteously disturbing but also frustrating, uneven and clich√©d.",1
15000, Generic yet entertaining...,1
75084," There's considerable gap between level of ambition and level of execution in Tony (American History X) Kaye's problem picture, which is preachy, didactic and dramatically flawed.",0
66901," Taken on its own, it's a mixed bag of grief and visual magic tricks that provides pleasant enough passive viewing, but doesn't do the greatest job of putting flesh on its characters' bones.",1
42825, You'll feel like you're an unwilling passenger along for a bumpy trip in John Dahl's road rage thriller Joy Ride -- Dahl dresses up this fuel-injected spectacle with silly-minded edge-of-your-seat fury,0
44993," Step Up is so predictable, so remarkably so, you might wonder how such a movie got made.",0
64815," Of course the movie lacks any sort of logic, but why does that matter if we've never seen an actual zombie horde? Better to enjoy the action and forget that it's not supposed to be a work of art. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
38531, ... conceived and executed on a much higher level than the outrageous true-life criminal scheme it depicts.,1
69736," I staggered out of this shameless, interminable movie feeling as if I'd been force-fed a ton of mealy, artificially sweetened baby food.",0
28950, I've had more exciting conversations on the phone with my mother.,0
19428," One might quibble with the CGI battle sequences ..., but that's a small complaint. As long as [the film] concentrates on the scheming royals in their lush and lavish settings, it soars.",1
41861," A fresh, quirky, unusually intelligent comedy about a 16-year-old girl who wins our hearts in the first scene.",1
76836," Not quite as good as you've heard, more neo-Woody Allen material from Baumbach and Gerwig, but often amusing.",1
60925," . . . the fact remains that despite death threats and worse, this trio of men had the courage of their convictions and the strength of character to speak out.",1
44829," While well made, strongly acted and relatively intriguing the film doesn't have a distinguishing feature to make it a cinematic must see, be that a charismatic star turn, sumptuous locations or thrilling action.",1
44650," In our own era of continuous armed conflicts, innocent deaths and PTSD, the public's naivet√© about the ""glories"" of war has long since faded to black...",0
226," Like many a sequel that has exhausted its plot possibilities, Secret of the Tomb looks abroad to add color and culture.",1
52315, A sumptuously designed and minutely detailed work that manages to remain compelling despite its essential familiarity while featuring top-notch contributions from everyone on both sides of the camera.,1
34587, Velvet Buzzsaw would capture more genuine horror if it had just followed the money.,0
59360," In the spirit of the holiday family saga, I cry, Uncle.",0
77555, We are before a very good action movie and probably one of the three best of this saga carried out by Tom Cruise. [Full Review in Spanish],1
106," The movie meanders from one decade to another, but Giamatti commands the screen as brainy, womanizing, boozing, out-of-control, charming TV producer Barney Panofsky. Paul Mazursky would have known how to direct this movie",1
31878," Bening and Bell unveil a spectrum of talent that stamps their performances throughout with the seal of equal engagement, not only as characters, but as the co-stars.",1
57639," While there's much to admire in this technical push, it's only affecting in fits. ",1
48400, The script sometimes seems to have been written by a 13-year-old.,0
81289, A film that blends a blockbustery bluster with a gaunt apocalyptic sobriety to good effect that is only compromised by its latter stages.,1
6569," Lady Bird's center is the relationship between Christine and her mother, and Metcalf's performance is a knockout.",1

5330, There are moments of bad taste black comic brilliance in this feature debut.,1
49462," Zenovich has assembled better-than-usual talking heads, all sympathetic even when dishing the worst bad behavior.",1
32487," This is a film more about the sacredness of our memories than the evil ways of gentrification, but skilled director Kleber Mendonca Filho is clearly interested in both.",1
48859," Solid but unremarkable performances from Page and Wood, who aren't given much to work with apart from generic anxiety and low-key squabbling, contribute to the overall listlessness.",0
3304," A backstage drama that has all the sizzle of a glass of water resting on the windowsill, Olivier Assayas' ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" mistakes lack of dramatic imagination for smoldering subtlety.",0
28367, Alfonso Cuar√≥n's futuristic adventure derives its power from a premise as potent and primal as they come,1
41827," An intriguing genre experiment, ""Sapi"" conjures up plenty of unease but doesn't have much in the way of story or character to drive its message home.",0

75882, Mullett mediocrity.,0

10289, Zoe constructs a dialogue between these two critically adored movies and peels apart the kind of fantasy they satisfy in order to obligingly critique it.,1
23805," ""The Outsider"" is a slick copy of multiple, much-better films and TV series. It's so well-polished it's practically featureless.",0
62042," clash of different horror modes & eras engenders an irony that is often funny & increasingly strange, as Here Comes Hell brings about its own deconstruction, literally collapsing on the ancient foundations that support its knowingly flimsy premise",1

24969," Silly, plotless, slow.",0

20397," Davis bangs on about honesty, but his words and unlikely actions just don't hang together.",0
41878," Gorgeous, gossipy, yet penetrating documentary about the marriage of culture and commerce. ",1
61913, staggeringly clueless,0
81691," A great life, and its depiction produces a treasury of costuming and hairdressing flair to hide the relationship and drama within drawing room walls.",1
64702, Don't worry your little head with the niceties of plot; they don't matter much.,1

39134," It's a mess, a boring mess, featuring boring Ryan Reynolds.",0
1583," There's a natural drama in life, an organic meditation in the preparation of ground beef or the cutting of pork chops, the sharpening of a knife. They're the tiny bits of life that Wiseman's film clings to.",1

83610," It's a potent return to (de)form for the Canadian filmmaker, whose most recent effort, A Dangerous Method, lacked the ferocity of classics Crash, Videodrome, and The Fly. The body horror is back here, but so too is the scorching social commentary. ",1

56641," Wait, this isn't about the deplorable idiots on the internet? That's one good title wasted.",0
8053," An excellent central performance from Dave Davis and the promise of director Jameson Brooks makes this a noteworthy film for anyone hoping to discover fresh talent, but even those just looking for a good individual film will find this satisfying",1
46466," Ruben √ñstlund's latest film skewers artists and their patrons, immigrants and natives, and even the homeless. But it exemplifies the kind of middle-class, middle-brow, liberal intellectualism it's supposed to be mocking.",0
36673," Doesn't boast a plot to match its hilariously over-the-top title, but it offers enough scares and chuckles to make for an enjoyably ghoulish cinematic roller-coaster ride.",1
8260," Thompson brings a sly wit to some scenes, and her absence is felt when she leaves the screen time to the bickering children.",0
2180," The sharp modern choreography is entrancing and adds a physicality to the magic that gave it impact, even more so than in the original.",1
41808, Yet another superhero pic but one nicely rooted in history.,1
63127," An intimate, illuminating doc that puts the focus on M.I.A.'s activism instead of her music and is, in some ways, all the more admirable for it.",1
31534, If Jafar Panahi was still looking to show the power of artistic expression over the filmmaking ban placed on him ... he has found an ideal approach with his new film - in good humour.,1
44019," A movie musical that certainly knows how to carry a tune, but is missing a heart.",0
64032," What little edge this tale had has been rubbed right off for this stale, slow and mirthless sequel",0
72981," As a conservative southern mom, an imperious Russian choreographer, or a wild-eyed homeless Glaswegian, Blanchett is clearly having a blast.",1
75519," Dull and way too long, Torn Curtain is only memorable for one very shocking and brutal scene.",0
78858," Goldstein is enormously endearing, while Drever milks the mundanity for laughs and unexpected sweetness.",1
70537," That this gloomy movie partly succeeds is a credit to the sharp dialogue, the fine cast and the directing debut of a reluctant star.",1
44478," Forget the puff-puff. Pass on this protracted, problematic comedy with Hot Fuzz aspirations in which neither Seth Rogen nor the grim, leaden violence is much fun at all. James Franco, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson at least salvage the film.",0

32030," The minutes tick toward 3:10, and all we can do is watch and hope that it all turns out ok. That's the best kind of Western, one that allows feelings like that to emerge while watching.",1
16730, A fantastic conclusion even if a bit bloated.,1
22721," While it may be little more than a Disney princess movie with a body count, I'd take this goofy period whodunit over brooding vampires and modern teen angst any day.",1
14087, Does Battle of the Sexes break new ground in terms of cinematic form? No. But it's an exceedingly well-done film... ,1
11288," The movie is a trifle, yes, but it is a fantastically entertaining trifle that made me smile, laugh, cry and at times even coo like a teenage schoolgirl.",1
80089, Basically an Antipodean reprise of When Harry Met Sally that sets its sights too low to be anything more than a pleasant diversion.,1
76184, A powerful piece of dramatic film-making which sheds light on the female MƒÅori perspective.,1
79901," The movie seems a little undernourished in the story department, and attempts to infuse the proceedings with adult-pleasing humor don't always rise to brilliant levels.",0
47073, The violent yet artful stylings of Korean director Park Chan-Wook are applied to a Southern Gothic plot with artistically queasy results.,0
78293," Trying too hard to grab our attention, [Marshall] loses it. The art of the geisha prizes subtlety, stillness, grace. Why doesn't this movie?",0
67351," As long as you have an idea of what you're in for, 127 Hours is more weirdly entertaining than it is grim. ",1

63349," It's everything wrong with bad romantic comedies, all rolled into one easy-to-hate package.",0
26980," takes no chances, but what it lacks in originality it makes up for by being so completely enraptured by the music that it takes the audience along with it",1
11446," With a dollop more originality and slightly less patronizing Kleenex moments, this picture might have left its mark on the chick flick genre, but as it stands, it's an also-ran.",0
82958," Enjoyable enough, if a little overblown.",1
77180," Columbus is extremely assured - beautiful, pristine work that is deliberate in its pacing, artfully and precisely framed in every moment, soulful and quietly moving without being overly sentimental.",1
39489," A few bright spots aside, Bowfinger's jokes almost universally fall flat, with missed comic opportunities buzzing by at every turn.",0
44060," It is an elegantly crafted, expertly acted old-fashioned weepie that manages to sell a whopper of a plot that would bring a blush to the cheeks of Nicholas Sparks.",1
42764," When this modish satire of teenage rebellion was released at the fag-end of the 1960s, it must have seemed a lot more cutting than it does now.",0

58546," Like Hoop Dreams, the movie doesn't really have an ending, but it doesn't have a beginning, either. It simply observes a year in the life of a city, and a community that's made it their mission to deal with a difficult situation.",1
67589," Daddy's Home is the white bread of family comedies, stuffed with everything you've seen before.",0

9206," Loaded with potential, it's puzzlingly overblown and distant, as if its huge budget were an albatross around its neck.",0
40128," A typical Sundance type comedy that confuses quirkiness with humor. Needless to say, it stars Paul Dano in his typically weird character role. A totally annoying film.",0

38404," The good news? Now that all of the tedious exposition has been gotten, glacially, out of the way, ""Part II"" will probably be terrific.",0
13809," If one is hip to the references (and, proudly or not, I am), it's amazing to see how precisely the metal-punk- turned-moviemaker Zombie channels the gleefully nihilistic tone and even the low-budget bleached-out quality of his disreputable inspirations.",1

46866, ...a melancholy film.,1
24980," Mr. Semb√®ne hasn't missed a step, and we're lucky to have him back on his path.",1
61045," Oh sure, the film's about 20 minutes too long, the pacing is all over the place and the movie's star Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson couldn't carry a dramatic scene in a paper bag. But I say again, not terrible.",1
71764," If the fate of the Furious series is to grow somehow both wearier and dumber with age, then the eighth film is proof of a mission firmly accomplished. And there's no shame, Vin, in hanging it all up after a job well done.",1
79286, Lame and lifeless.,0
1684, ...an eye opening account of human dignity.,1
13774, All that keeps the movie from collapsing into soap opera is the exuberant drive of the filmmaking. And the central performance. Van Houten is pretty without being beautiful.,1

15047," I wouldn't have thought Gere could play a wannabe macher (Yiddish for someone who gets things done), but he's on target. For him, Norman was a risk worth taking.",1

71590, The performances of Brady Corbet as the taciturn American and Mati Diop as the sympathetic prostitute lend the film watchability ...,1
76069," As much as it is a poignant story of love and loss, 'Away From Her' is also a modern-day horror tale.",1
64629," Random, contrived and generally pointless",0
61940, Support the Girls invites questions about why it exists and whether it offers an experience worth the price of admission and the investment of time.,0
74058," A good holiday movie for kids and adults. Although the story is easily understood by kids, there are plenty of jokes and innuendos that will sail right over most kids' heads.",1
53097," Those with a high tolerance for violence and gore - at one point, Rama battles assassins labeled ""Baseball Bat Man'' and ""Hammer Girl'' simultaneously - will eat up ""The Raid 2.''",1
78340, The result is memorable; viewing is mandatory.,1
82729," England 1818 seems like a Fragonard garden, the pastoral height of civilization. Conversation is witty; summer feels eternal.",1
38111," Director Zack Snyder is one of the most exciting, unpredictable filmmakers around, and after watching this one, well, you can still say he's unpredictable, if not always exciting.",0
49596, While it's not a perfect film - though the first hour just may be - A Star Is Born boasts more than enough passion to make up for some of its narrative hiccups.,1
59078, About as scary as a Jack-o-Lantern in broad daylight.,0
8188, Marsh ... masterfully spins a harrowing tale of human arrogance that eventually gives way to cruelty bordering on the pathological.,1

9242, This is one hell of a fascinating ride.,1
40165, Film-makers Todd Phillips and co make no apologies for being creatures of habit and sticking to what worked for them before.,1
73367," Sitting through ""Waking Life"" is like being trapped in a painting filled with philosophy students",0
15842," While ostensibly explaining how the Grinch got so Grinch-like, it also inclines the viewer to raise other questions. How did he score that mountaintop mansion? What's with the elaborately twisted pipe organ?",0
82169," Humane and harrowing, highly recommended. This one will stay with you.",1
60409," Resembling little more than a two-hour video game, the high-energy movie is positive enough about the strength of family to forgive the challenges of the format and simply go along for the (very loud and noisy) ride offered by the Wachowski brothers.",1
74005," A fun lark, but despite its humour and occasional sweetness it still feels disposable. ",0
28377," The fact that Travis Van Winkle's smarmy rich kid is a dead ringer for Michael Bay has got to be some sort of inside joke, right?",0

32707, I was left with a greater understanding and appreciation of his work.,1
73264," The clever camera moves and inventive uses of stagecraft feel like sound and fury, signifying nothing.",0
44931," ...an unnerving werewolf tale that explores themes of motherhood and otherness, sometimes suggesting a retelling of Frankenstein. But with a werewolf. Yet for all the blood and gore, this is a quiet, gentle story...",1
81867, A wonderfully acted film and a courageous one.,1
5111," Get Smart is made up of feeble and funny jokes, brand actors and enough special effects to give you some bang for your summertime buck.",0
33898, The cinematography is at times breathtaking and there is no doubting this director's enormous talent and his use of singing is also very effective.,1
75729, Payne abandons his biting eye for satire with this uninspired and mean road picture. Makes one long for a car drive with Mr. McAllister and Warren Schmidt.,0
75780," One of Demme's great skills is his sense of balance; set pieces are alternately propelled by ratcheting tension and slow, mounting dread, while his exquisite match cuts between parallel storylines keep the pace nimble.",1
6748, McLaren is not exactly Senna and certainly not Rush.,1
23899, Heineman's close-up look at the war on drugs bathes the situation in the personal stakes of the figures enmeshed in these thorny dilemmas on a daily basis. ,1
9889," It's Kiplingesque nursery ethology, and one distrusts the editing.",0
49448," It's a working-class view of the future where the stakes are high, nothing works properly, and there's no one coming to save you. ",1

2556, It's hardly the most gracefully made indie on the block -- more like a whole season of a sitcom crammed into one feature.,0
33396, Finders Keepers takes the ludicrous true-life story of two North Carolina men fighting over possession of a mummified leg and slowly unpacks it to find genuine pathos and sorrow.,1
63002," Nanni Moretti's latest is a mixed bag that too often settles for easy, superficial laughs.",0
25243," In one eye and out the other, the sullen remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still airlifts certain story details straight from its source material.",0
36858, It all looks suspiciously like the kind of movie Allen used to make fun of 30 years ago.,0
5843, RBG's superficiality makes it good background material about the subject and the forces that guided her life's crusade but the blinders it willingly wears represent its greatest flaw.,0
53528," If trying to straddle the chasm caused by the clash of a serious subject and a levity-filled, entertainment-oriented approach remains ill-fitting, so too do the key performances. ",0
55074," Although the movie often goes cross-eyed trying to figure out how to slip out of scenes, it retains joy and a rich sense of curiosity, brought to life through three terrific lead performances.",1
3125," This movie is tripped up by a jumbled narrative and corporate machination: Warner Bros. is desperately chasing the highly successful Marvel film universe, and the only way to get there is to rush.",0
75050," If ""An Inconvenient Truth"" is the go-to for global warming and ""Food, Inc."" factory farming, ""Countdown to Zero"" is the documentary primer on nuclear arms.",1

63952," Lavish and lengthy, it has the spectacle and spirit of a Saturday matinee movie but not its fleetness or fun.",1
68229," Choppy, point-of-view twisting thriller that never rises above its gimmickry.",0
75759," The novelty of it being played out on a golf course dissipates in a few rounds, and it becomes the usual 'tamasha' between goons and good 'uns, and haves and have-nots, its good-natured daftness drowning in silliness.",0
3221," There's not always something definite to chew on, but there's always an artist's impulse behind it.",1

6702," After eight successful if downward-spiralling seasons, the concept hasn't just run completely dry. In Doug Ellin's feature-length spin-off, it feels starkly and cynically exposed.",0
3259," The film isn't merely unfunny and stupefyingly inane but a depressing waste of money, energy and time, yours included.",0
47453," Eisenberg has taken some PR hits lately but neither they, nor his often misunderstood demeanor, should detract from his frenetic, brilliant portrayal of Mike.",1
71487," Funeral services are already under way at the nation's multiplexes, so the easily entertained might want to pay their respects before this one gets buried by newer releases.",0
30586, It's genuinely shocking how un-funny this movie is.,0
17836," This is a darker, more soulful entry with some fun set pieces. But it's definitely wearying and no amount of candle-lit exposition can make a slight plot interesting. Time to lay anchor for good?",1
43274, Never approaches the sometimes-hilarious horror of real life.,0

73247, The images gorgeously embody both the fear and the beauty of James's exploratory experiments with socialization. ,1
39254," It isn't perfect, but Prometheus is a thoroughly entertaining summer blockbuster that is a cut above the rest due to an amazing cast and Ridley Scott, who re-establishes himself as one of our greatest world building filmmakers.",1

37450, Just sign on for the trip. Back to the Future offers the summer's most dazzling joyride.,1
15626," An impeccable film of risky dramatic range, taking into account its commercial ambitions, and unquestionable political message. [Full review in Spanish]",1

75734," ...the emphasis is on comedy and lightness highlighted by award quality performance, especially by Lawrence and Adams, who appears in extremely revealing clothes throughout.",1
23343," It's not that overwrought violence and human depravity are unfit grist for art, but without a compelling plot and a modicum of character development, all this film has to offer is a repugnant prurience and heavy-handed atmospherics.",0
6039," A repulsive movie, marred by grotesquely hammy acting and inscrutable presentation by Brian De Palma.",0
58152," Yang's methods bring a melancholy tenderness to his recollections. He films intricately staged action in long takes of a rueful, contemplative reserve.",1
34355, This film was well worth the wait.,1
48277," While this feels different than anything Jarmusch has done before, there's just enough that's familiar that I think it fits beautifully into the body of work he's been building.",1

48362," For a film so unambiguously cheering for its heroes, it has an unsettling way of questioning the cost of their achievement.",1
25615," Mostly delightful. It can give you the foreboding you feel when encountering the word ""artisanal,"" but otherwise this nested story of Central European skullduggery seems to have more of a spine than anything he's made since Fantastic Mr. Fox. ",1
1519," The fresh premise over, the stale action returns.",0

50485, Pokerfaced Steve Carell and Tina Fey play Phil and Claire. Both do dead-on deadpan. It alone sells steak that doesn't have much sizzle.,1
11374," It's a beauty, perhaps largely because it's as much about recent history as about its characters' Jewishness.",0
57718, At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd. But it would be better to wait for the video. And a very rainy day.,0
30488," Bela Tarr's style seems to be an attempt to regard his characters with great intensity and respect, to observe them without jostling them, to follow unobtrusively as they move through their worlds, which look so ordinary and are so awesome, like ours.",1
38073," Less satisfying than his previous pic, yet still a bold, melancholy statement.",1

46045, Its rote characters invite none of our empathy or concern in a plot unencumbered by depth or surprises.,0
77925," ""Steel Magnolias"" is essentially a series of comic one-liners leading up to a teary tragedy, but let it be said that the one-liners are mostly funny and the tragedy deserves most, but not all, of the tears.",1
69367," Well, they saved the best for last.",1
15742," True to Spielberg, the action sequences don't let up. Tintin's adventures transition seamlessly from ocean liner to biplane to sand dunes to Moroccan streets.",1
81985," This is a clipped, fragmented piece of cinematic modernism, shuffling its time frames in a staccato narrative that makes for a tense, involving experience from start to finish.",1
71961," There are big laughs in some of the farcical situations here, but the nostalgic vibe built into the soundtrack spills over into a throwback sensibility that aims warmer and cuddlier than the material demands.",0
77292," Nicloux escalates Suzanne's travails at just the right pace, wrestling his final act back from ""The Perils of Pauline"" territory to conclude with an shocking suggestion which brings the material's themes back to the forefront.",1
27756," The movie seem to turn away from the very idea that there is anything to build toward, in either life and in art: things happen and then more things happen.",1
11993," Communicates the world of the singer-songwriter brilliantly. That said, as a complete film on its own -- Once could be more fulfilling.",1
70341," Whether you choose to perceive it as a goof, a satire, or a little of both, Rubber is undeniably audacious. ",1

3278, The summer blockbuster we've been waiting for.,1
67206," Feig's Ghostbusters is its own definitive creature, an affable, inventive riff on Ivan Reitman's proton-packing caper that exists not to score points, but only to make us laugh. For a summer comedy, there's no nobler purpose.",1
7613, The focus of this documentary is the work and life - the former overwhelmed the latter - of iconoclastic American photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. ,1

20896," Selznick places Hitchcock on a leash, but I still can't get Mrs. Danvers out of my head!",1
29397, It's not just the characters that lack humour; the film itself seems to forget the parts of it which are entertaining.,0

73446," You come, and you stay, for Oldman ... [His performance is] uncanny, it's technically virtuosic, it's mesmerising ... [he] gets the humour, the doubt, the drunkenness, the moods, the intelligence, the heart and soul. ",1
18911," A ridiculous, white-collar Saw.",0

46264," Joe Talbot's film is deep and important, and yet watching it is a breeze.",1
68017," It's certainly not that there aren't a few funny moments in the film. There are, but overwhelmingly, Bruno's stunts are demeaning, they are insulting and they are really cruel.",0

4891," Brother's Nest will make you laugh, hold tight to the armrest of your seat, and then cry with its tale of a dysfunctional family.",1
29029," The film's claustrophobic one-location setting is continually opening out thanks to comic digressions and gonzo flashbacks, which are vividly brought to life in Gondry's trademark sticky-back-plastic style.",1
19438," Hopkins at least has fun hamming things up, but the film around him simply goes through the motions.",0
78568," Eytan Fox depicts modern gay life and contemporary Tel Aviv with sympathy and knowing insight, and he excels at creating casual rapport among actors; yet in film after film he undermines these gifts with hamfisted melodramatic plotting.",0
45901," A false start for both Cage and Green, two singular cinematic voices who have drifted too far into the seas of commercialism.",0
71443," A fashionably sleek, unfashionably smart science-fiction film that tick-tick-ticks along with pocket-watch precision.",1
64526," ""The Boss"" has zero finesse as a comedy. When Darnell crashes into a wall, or takes a tumble down the stairs, it's alarming and painful, as opposed to funny.",0
65010," This long-distance love story is comfort food in any language, perfectly agreeable and unlikely to surprise.",1
78930," Beyond this intellectual actualisation, I can't help but think that the film falls short of its supposed brilliance. Surely watching socially or politically charged documentaries should achieve something more than cognition! ",0
21351," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon isn't just one of the best movies of the year; it's one of the best movies, period.",1
60809," It's always fun to watch scaly, skyscraper-sized behemoths lay waste to civilisation, but a bit more human drama would be welcome.",1
9683," Wonderstruck's finale finds [Todd] Haynes in top form, depicting loss, memories, and hope in a way I don't think I've ever seen before. ",1
6924," An ambitiously conceived, sometimes frustratingly elliptical family chronicle that shows one family's experience immediately following the Japanese occupation of the nation.",1
17150," It is undeniably exciting and awe-inspiring; but it also lacks a sense of tactile warmth, a crucial core of reality.",1
60247," The succession of references stops just short of the risible, while the use of the split-screen to show scenes from different angles and the elaborate tracking shots indicate the arrival of a prodigious new stylist forging an original signature.",1
9798, Fearless and fabulous,1
701, An ancient time... when master criminals were manly men with giant tools.,1
54175," Dom Hemingway is often viciously funny, and every time you think the movie has run out of steam, Shepard spins things in a new direction, keeping the energy from flagging (including one of the most startling car crashes I've ever seen in a film).",1
39122," Bottom line: should you watch Triple 9? No! Is it a slick thriller? Yes, but only in its looks.",0
43615," Another descendant of Stacy Peralta's influential Dogtown and Z-Boys, but more stylish and engaging than most of its less inquisitive, like-minded, hagiographic stunt spectaculars.",1
15809," A tragi-comedy, yes. It's also beautiful and unique - art of a high order. In its portrayal of stark philosophical differences, the movie speaks to how people across generations see, and find meaning in, modern life.",1
54601, masterfully entertaining film on a limited budget,1
30095, What is Slumdog Millionaire? A. The next Little Miss Sunshine. B. The greatest movie of all time. C. The most overrated movie of 2008. D. The most un-Danny Boyle Danny Boyle film. Only one answer...,1

54558," Touches of wit and insight enliven the first half, but Carrie eventually devolves into lackluster modern horror cliches for a souped-up version of the famous finale.",0
6373," allows for the digital manipulation of virtually everything on screen, turning the movie into a frenetic, attention-deficit cartoon that still manages to look kinda cheap",0
79313," It is a tale of white trash immorality on a grand scale, of people who are ridiculous and yet dangerous, laughable but cunning, and really stupid ... yet sneaky.",1
44571," Not funny, romantic, or realistic and instead wallows in that only-in-Hollywood area usually occupied by bad sitcoms or made-for-cable movies",0
65650," In the autumn of his career, toiling exclusively in Europe, Woody is like an aging cabinet maker still blessed with craft but grown erratic in design.",0
47688," Winslet and Elba give it their all, but The Mountain Between Us is an absurd and forgettable affair that makes little impact with viewers.",0
59369, [A] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment.,0
7884, There are bits of brilliance here as in all Coen Brothers movies. Just not enough of them.,0
32412," A fun, cheerful time passer that's filled with many random zingers that will leave you snickering afterward.",1
1152, The teeming cast is so vitally real that acting seems nearly superfluous.,1
20429," Ultimately, if you are able to accept the absurdity of it all and not demand answers to the question, Why? - you'll get the maximum enjoyment out of this gem.",1
54181, A superb performance from Madds Mikkelsen lies at the heart of this chilling tale of a small Danish community turning on an innocent man. ,1
23491," Tom Cruise rules in this immensely entertaining action thriller that smartly doesn't try to be anything other than what it is, and that's a very good thing for movie fans.",1
14502, The movie is well cast.,1
41027," Like [Albert] Brooks, [Lake] Bell has an off-kilter perspective that keeps you laughing even as it threatens to capsize the story.",1
54271, Gavron is blessed with a talented cast that's fully invested in the project. Duff and Carter transform what could be cliched roles while Gleeson and Whishaw make the men more than one-dimensional villians.,1
38935," Fascinating but unfocused docu on media, ethics, power. ",1
68614," Mean Girls lacks sincerity, and instead acts like any teenage queen bee -- being cruel and picking on the weak -- only to then break its own rules and be hypocritical.",0
80126," In the end, this is a smart movie that could have been smarter. The script feels like it was a draft or so away from total clarity and focus. But the energy of the cast and a dive into an unfamiliar world make the movie rather addictive.",1
19031," It isn't the most subtle movie, with characters constantly spelling out the big message - in order to change the world, you first have to change yourself.",1
52868," It's a work of art, a sci-fi funhouse, and hilarious all at once.",1
27815," A kitsch-fest; a kit-and-caboodle thematic ransacking sellout, geared to drain your kiddie dollars. Like a city dump, you can find anything in there-but would you want to?",0
30853," Outrageousness proves hard to sustain, and after a stomach-lurchingly quick start, The Hangover slows down and, by the third act, fizzes out like Alka-Seltzer in a highball glass.",0
43268," A real baying-at-the-moon gorefest, unusual both for its savagery and for a half-decent performance from Hartnett.",1
38242," Anderson and his story collaborators have outdone themselves with this wild odyssey involving mystery, intrigue, lots of action and humor --- but most of all, a story steeped in the importance of friendship and loyalty. ",1
74144," It is a polished, exciting piece of work.",1
47546, The eerie-jumpy bits simply don't pan out satisfyingly or convincingly.,0
60864," The film's a delight, it's festive, sweet, darkly funny, pretty to look at and pure family fun.",1
48669," Pomposity and foolishness abound, but the laughs are few and far between.",0
69793," Wolf's film is still admirable, and aided by a pretty spot on score by Deerhunter frontman Bradford Cox, Teenage feels both present and past.",1
17293," A wry, playful and intelligent piece of filmmaking that, like Toy Story before it, rises far above its station. ",1
9377," Boyle gets too caught up in a blind sprint of disorientation, and Trance, as busy as it imagines itself to be, registers as lot of heavy breathing without any oxygen to spare.",0
4896, More lifeless than its namesake's long-dead body.,0
75852, How do you take an utterly fascinating true story and turn it into something dull and predictable? See Winchester to find out the answer to that question.,0
6468," Like Romero's best efforts, the movie is motored by a keen observational reality, cleverly twisting the characters' mundane world inch by inch until the real nightmare dawns on them.",1
30768," A Walk in the Woods takes only minimal effort to watch, and leaves you with nothing much worth remembering. ",0
8790," Inherent Vice is a little too zonked, meandering and overly long, an ultimately pointless story told by a stoned person.",0
13943," In the end, the commercial necessity of wrapping up a family comedy in less than 100 minutes seems to have trumped anything real about Dan's life.",0

56602, A well-intentioned but ultimately disappointing film that is perhaps afraid of its own subject.,0
57651," What makes this one of the year's most notable movies, is the way DuVernay cuts through the immense mythology to delve into King's brilliant political mind. ",1
54243, Madhur Bhandarkar's latest film has a confused narrative and melodrama that dethrones the attempt to champion the cause of democracy.,0
66334, That Ruben Fleischer lacks a discernible directorial identity is one reason the film will likely skip right out of your memory within the titular timeframe.,0
62350," In his best performance of the post-Governator era, Arnold Schwarzenegger stars ... in a film that eschews traditional zombie movie expectations in favour of a more character-driven drama.",1
54831," There is a lot of music, but never too much, and the story of Beethoven's struggle with his life and genius emerges forcefully and movingly.",1
45317," The production deserves credit for expanding on clich√©s, but all the dramatic expansion eventually gums up the works.",0
53021," Whatever his imprint on the film might be, it's overshadowed by the performances of its stellar, veteran cast, to whom Hoffman wisely gives ample rein.",1

10025, exactly what you'd expect from a spoof of found footage movies released in January without advanced screenings for critics,0
57668," You don't need to be fan of The Who to enjoy this documentary. It's universal themes include an analysis of opposites attracting, genius marketing, creative nurturing and the inevitable clashing dynamics of a rock 'n roll band.",1

67380," Thankfully an increase in both star wattage and finances has not distracted the brothers one single bit, their darkly acerbic comedy one of the better %u2013 and funnier %u2013 motion pictures I've had the delight to view this year.",1

39192," It may not be earthshaking, but this calmly competent feel-good movie shows that a little sincerity can go a long way.",1
51554," A story like this can't get by on terror alone. It also needs good actors to put it across, and Alien: Convenant more than delivers on that score.",1

46477," That BATTLESHIP ISLAND is heartfelt piece of patriotic fanservice doesn't keep the film from being an undisciplined, scattered, overlong mess, and the worst movie Director Ryoo Seung-wan has made. ",0
79212, A raunchy but good-natured adaptation of the preposterous 1990s television show.,1

18766," Happy-Go-Lucky isn't one of Leigh's epic social canvases like Secrets & Lies or even Topsy-Turvy; rather, it's an edgy character study whose message only gradually emerges.",1
67747," [A] sly, satisfying thriller about class, status and violence.",1
73562," ""Battlefield Earth,"" based on a crappy 1982 sci-fi novel by cult religion dips#*t L. Ron Hubbard, is so inept and pathetic that it should forever end any questions about the validity of Hubbard's manufactured religion of Scientology.",0
81772," Played to perfection by Paul Giamatti, Pekar defies the categories of hero, villain, or even anti-hero. He simply exists, an ordinary man trying to make the best of a largely disappointing life.",1
65319," The script is not funny or even humorous, or logical, or satirical...The sepia type color makes it unpleasant to watch.",0
60176," There could be a much better version of this scenario; but there just as easily could be, and have been, versions that are incomparably worse.",1
22775," The plots have ground down to near nothingness, the wisecracks aren't wise or crack-y anymore, and the original stars mostly lumber around like middle-aged slabs of spa-toned beefcake.",0
36421," Movies that mix magic and gritty realism almost never work , but Zeitlin, who is making an auspicious feature directing debut, pulls it off with awesome results.",1
31699," This glum, grim British drama picks through the remains of a seafaring disaster.",0

75417," If international intrigue was a hate crime, Dowdle and his co-writer brother Drew would be guilty as charged.",0
24863, Arizona might have worked better as a smart-ass social commentary if its tsk-tsking of consumerist myopia wasn't so consistently on the nose and its plot didn't swiftly devolve into slasher movie cliches.,0
63765," Truthfully, despite all my grievances, I rather liked BVS. Unlike nearly all of the Marvel movies, it feels like the work of an actual filmmaker instead of a glorified television production.",0
41883, There's simply nothing here worth yelling about.,0
55135," On so many levels, A Mighty Heart is almost as excruciating to write about as it is to watch. It has many of the virtues of a first-rate political thriller, and yet who can think of it in those terms?",1
76114," The pile-up of effects is like watching someone else playing videogames; neat moves, but where's the fun?",0
40212, This high-concept Eddie Murphy vehicle is weak even by the low standards of the star's recent output.,0

24684," A flawed but interesting downbeat Brit thriller with some creepy, leftfield jolts, calling to mind Mike Hodges with a twist of Tarantino.",1
9249," Knight and Day is often so mindlessly preposterous (especially during the CGI-heavy action scenes) that it makes The A-Team look as complex as L.A. Confidential by comparison. Luckily, Cruise and Diaz both have their movie-star wattage burning bright.",0
32082," Tight editing (there's never any dislocation in sense of place while locale hopping) and well-framed shots hold the tension, as does Hibbert's well-gamed chess match of statesmanship and foreign policy.",1
28944," Paul Schrader offers a very personal and, at the same time, universalist, film... that even allows brief moments of ""magical realism"". [Full review in Spanish]",1
51237," The action gives way, time and time again, to the inaction of people sitting there, explaining why they're there and how they got there and why they're not leaving, which isn't thrilling at all.",0

77171," Bruno is outrageous, sick and offensive but pretty damn hilarious.",1
955," Sleek and stylish, harrowing yet heartening, Danny Boyle and James Franco bring their best picture to the big screen.",1
70485, An abysmal horror movie that apparently wants to evoke the spirit of paranormal thrillers of the sixties (like 'The Haunting') but quickly degenerates into a chaotic mishmash of modern genre tropes.,0

5716, There's no fate but what box office we can make.,0
28574," It's an enjoyable movie. The problem with The Meg is that while it definitely chomps at your senses, it's just not ridiculous enough to be memorable.",1

12757," It captures the imaginative sparks that come out of comic readers' minds, urging them to turn page after page.",1

29172," The book and movie's key line, 'We accept the love we think we deserve,' rings true in any age.",1
63237," [An] absorbingly sadistic psychological whodunnit. Fixating in its gripping hold, Zodiac is convincingly haunting in its head-scratching mode.",1
68214," With the stakes rising a scene at a time, Skyscraper was always going to be the film that offered pure escapist entertainment.",1
36094," Shot mostly across scenic landscapes in New Mexico, Colorado and Utah, including Monument Valley, [it acts] as a visual tribute to some of the great Westerns of history shot by the likes of John Ford. This Lone Ranger won't be joining their ranks.",0

48007," Badlands is an arena for apathy, both in regard to the characters' depictions and their subjective emotions.",1
34014," Haunted is much more loyal to the original amusement attraction than the freewheeling and more imaginative Pirates film, which is good for nostalgia but not especially good for storytelling.",0
26342," David O. Russell's comedy about private eyes looking into the unseen is unexpected, uneven and unpolished.",1
41072," This Oldboy is another pointless remake, and I couldn't swallow it.",0
40060," Makes his previous effort, Delta Farce, seem a classic by comparison.",0

76017," This explosively violent future-nightmare thriller, directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n and adapted from the novel by PD James, has simply the most extraordinary look of any movie around.",1
13821," This is a movie that really nails the seemingly oxymoronic phrase ""profoundly dumb.""",0
22891, A surprisingly strong horror thriller that easily kept my interest right up until its lackluster and predictable final act.,0
40945," In some scenes, Fiennes is too free with the handheld camera. But he does make the movie all-aquiver, rich in feeling.",1
68657," This week on ""When Bad Things Happen to Good Actors""...",0
73457," Charmingly affectionate, playful, and gorgeous, making one wish Favreau would just remain here, making movies about people being funny and real in interesting environments. He's simply terrific with this stuff.",1
43483," Blanchard and Verastegui are the stars of the show here, and their interplay of trust and light flirtation is what keeps Bella out of the death grip of convention.",1

27016, Where the script stumbles is in its absence of any especially funny setpieces or memorable lines.,0
25506," ...plays like a drunken mash-up of Beckett, Troma and Hitchcock. Dupieux knows how to riff on the behavior and language of cinema but isn't clever or outlandish enough to sustain his film's 85-minute running time.",0
82255," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will make you fall in love with film all over again.",1
39383," The film not only reveals little about its subject that wasn't already readily known, but also provides minimal perspective or analysis of why and how he was able to develop his talent.",0
29834, At 70-odd minutes it's a short film but not engrossing enough to make time fly. ,0
7492," Ultimately, though, The Possession of Hannah Grace leans on too many familiar horror elements to be unsettling.",0
71270, Incredibly perverse and weirdly fascinating look at the Soviet Union in the pre-Glasnost era.,1
47288," I've in the past grown impatient and exasperated with Haneke's oppressive sense of control, but there is something in The White Ribbon that feels eerily personal, almost confessional.",1

52718," Not that there were a ton of expectations for Hot Tub Time Machine 2, but however modest they were the film fails to meet them.",0
46480," It's bold, fleshy and audacious, at least in theory. But it is also numb.",0
28382," A fascinating marriage of genre and subject matter, this unique musical with recitative-like delivery, mockumentary-style dramatization and understated execution is a breath of fresh air",1

48157," 'Bad Boys II,' which is nothing more than tired formula, pure and simple, feels longer than 'Pearl Harbor.' And it's got a lot more explosions and violence than that World War II picture, too.",0
68375, What might have happened if Frank Herbert had written 'Dune' after a lobotomy.,0
4559," [Cronenberg's] dependence on DeLillo's source material means that the director is not entirely his own man, and the atmosphere of impending catastrophe that builds in the course of the film is constantly undermined by its bookish lines and set-ups.",0
10815," More than its visual brilliance, what captivates you the most is Del Toro's ability to capture the minutiae of his ordinary characters' everyday life. ",1
77018," The movie borrows from all the right places, including Edgar Allen Poe's Tell-Tale Heart and Sam Raimi's Evil Dead.",1
13897, Even those of us who genuinely look forward to the cinematic adventure that is each and every Wes Anderson film can be disappointed.,0

80737," 'Paper Towns' is an admirable film more due to what it tries to do, than to the final product, and although it does entertain, it could've done a lot more. [Full review in Spanish]",1
67868, Bronx Gothic...follows the usual pattern of Hollywood's imprisoning blacks within the limits of white liberal imagination...Rossi's liberalism - his whitesplaining - intrudes on his star's storytelling.,0

60538," It was a great premise, it just unfortunately did not come together.",0

37042, A wishy-washy little relationship comedy that's nowhere near as nasty as it evidently wants to be.,0

35822," It's neither romantic nor comedic. Sort of defeats the whole point of the exercise, you know?",0
20549," The final, and anti-climactic, 'threequel' of the summer has nothing new to say. A staleness pervades the film, despite all efforts to inject freshness and excitement into a tired story.",0

68714," It's a requel (prequel + remake). Same pattern, different characters. Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything better than John Carpenter's vision. ",0
33972, ...it seems obvious that the Spierigs are destined to go on to bigger and better things.,0
81863," An abhorrent cyberthriller starring a compelling Diane Lane, the film exploits the inhumanity of torture as it cynically condemns Internet rubberneckers (and by extension, moviegoers) for watching it online.",0

75190," Alas, this is neither edgy nor funny enough.",0

56723," Vice delivers some impressive performances, but as a narrative, there's room for improvement.",0
27316, The notion of art as a 'religious experience' is sometimes bandied about too freely. Tarkovsky is one of a handful of filmmakers for whom this ideal was no cheap metaphor.,1

3269," Exceptionally balanced and downright hilarious at times, and while Kelly covers well-worn ground, he does so with distinct personality and perspective, finding freshness in universal pain. ",1
71723," If not strictly autobiography, the movie is close enough to Eminem's story that he knows how this character feels. If this turns out to be the only role he ever plays -- which I doubt -- he can be happy that he played it to the limit.",1
3997," If you're in the mood for a boring by the numbers romantic comedy, this is for you.",0
73232, Less a dispassionate examination than a celebratory infomercial on its central character.,1

48212," Director Alice Winocour establishes an atmosphere of woozy paranoia, and uses Schoenaert's brooding presence to great effect. But the tension is dissipated when a real threat emerges, and Disorder turns into a conventional action thriller.",1

34304," Not badly executed, but not the least bit original either.",0

40228," As the movie poster reads, 'Everyone has a breaking point.' Hopefully 'Straw Dogs' is a breaking point for Hollywood to stop spitting out terribly done remakes.",0
70536," Even the likable stars, Jamie Sidegroin and Dakota Frontboob, can do nothing with material that has grown more tedious with each installment.",0
15279," Acker does himself no favors with rote anti-dogmatism and vapid characterizations. Despite that, though, his little creations remain oddly compelling.",0
34835," While the film's visual jokes are as funny as they are imaginative, the humor and inventiveness are yoked to an unusually poignant narrative.",1
39820," The film is more than skating, more than the intricate and beautiful motions these skaters demonstrate. It documents community and racial pride, pride that comes from not only black culture, but from black owned businesses as well.",1
10262, Fails in being an entertaining satire and a competent horror film...,0
71554," In throwing out wit and intelligence for mindless action, Twohy ends up with a noisy, chaotic, over-serious mess.",0
16512," Legend offers Hardy the sort of role that an actor can really sink their teeth into. And if the film itself doesn't ever really match the level of effort on hand, it's not for any lack of effort on the endlessly versatile actor's part.",1
28218," I suppose the way to watch this film, if you feel compelled to watch it by some masochistic tendency you are powerless to control, is to regard it as a comedy.",0
59264, The film with the year's best title proves to be a zany combination of drama and throwback science fiction. And then there's Sam Elliott...,1
53344," If a lump of coal was once the symbol of a worthless holiday gift, it's now a ticket to Eight Crazy Nights.",0

6293, [Director] Bier knows the difference between drama and melodrama.,1
79809, It's almost as if some actual drama pokes through the movie despite the better efforts of DeCubills' strange fealty to straightforward genre conventions.,1
28839," [An] unfortunately rather ropey film, destined to be blearily viewed on a thousand long-haul flights or channel-hoppingly glimpsed on your way past ITV4.",0
67343," ""Firewall"" is the kind of ho-hum winter doldrums film that begs for you get something classic from NetFlix",0
67877," I am a believer, but I confess I'm left with more doubts than certainties about Emily's case. This, perhaps, is what [the filmmakers] want to do: offer questions, not answers.",1
68485," White Boy Rick would have been helped by having a more dynamic lead actor in the title role, but newcomer Richie Merritt barely registers, and so it's never clear why everyone is so enamored with the kid. ",0
2495, Jennifer Garner breaks character by forgetting that she's playing an awkward 13-year-old girl in a 30-year-old woman's body in this girly comedy,0
28275, A mixture of seriousness and humor that doesn't quite gel...easier to respect for its ambition than to praise for its achievement.,0
49890," The rapid-fire gags result in a hit-or-miss pattern, ranging from the wickedly inspired to the overly broad.",0
44598," The withholding of judgment persists across Lourdes, which is comic, haunting, sweet, pious, unsettling, agnostic, and wholly deadpan at various moments.",1
756," Only the ultra-impressionable will be thrilled: not a single blow in its posy, prop-dependent fight scenes looks as though it connected, let alone hurt.",0
74264, It gently mocks the traditions of the genre -- giant preying mantis rips roof off high school -- while never getting too frightening.,1
37955," Occasionally the sentimental sweep of the picture threatens to overwhelm, but Taylor manages to pull it back in time.",1
81523," As ye sow, so shall ye reap - and for all its initial creepiness, in the end this Mid-western gothic yields a big cropful of corn.",0
14000," Before the movie has even really begun, it's already fudging its own premise and undermining its satire.",0
7926," Written and directed by Chad Hartigan, this touching, uncommonly humane drama centers on the tenuous friendship between two lonely older men.",1
42157, Director Akin's film is insanely heavy and completely free of the redemptive happy ending nonsense so common among Hollywood films. ,1
14305, Barnaby Southcombe makes a distinguished directorial debut with this stylish and atmospheric film noir.,1
73024," Dead Rising: Endgame gets even further away from what made Capcom's games so entertaining, to the point where ""Dead Rising"" could even be removed from Endgame's title.",0
83994," Inception is an intense, complex story, but it's always coherent, imaginative, and entertaining.",1
38927," If you can suspend disbelief at every odds-defying incident and mind-blowing improbability, the inspirational message may work on you like magic. If not, the film falls flat as a 60-second souffle.",0

52809, One of the things I liked best about the film is how it is grounded in the grim economics of the newspaper and recording industries. ,1
11753," Sinister, solemn and so familiar you could write the Latin curses in your sleep. Contains a truly hellish amount of The Doors.",0
62381," With this movie, both Pattinson and the Safdie brothers have broken new ground in their careers; if you haven't been keeping track of what either of them is up to, Good Time would be a good time to start.",1
71378," The film has its strengths, but empathetic characters are not one of them.",1
61185, Aaliyah steals the show as a villainous vampiric vixen in an otherwise ludicrous waste of a story.,0
71712," What's it about? Everything and nothing. Seriously: If wishes were horses, one would have walked into the movie and told us what exactly Braff thought was going on.",0
24638, It fixes the problems of its predecessor without making the first film irrelevant ...,1
39538," Despite my reservations, Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri is certainly memorably clever and boldly conceived. And any film that allows McDormand to strut her to stuff to this degree can't be all bad.",1
27169," With a script written by Allan Loeb, the film shockingly comes to a head with a very strange twist that seems way too far-fetched, even by movie standards.",1
20330, It's one of those films where we root for almost everybody.,1
21184, Perpetually feels a few good jokes away from being really funny.,0
7978, Fortunately everything is softened by a very intelligent sense of humor that knows how to make that premise a kind of evil mission of megalomaniac villain from the James Bond saga. [Full review in Spanish],1

33223, What do you say about a movie that's not really there?,0
8665," This is sort of ""Brazil"" without the intentional surrealism.",1
29221," The occasionally amusing Twilight Saga finds a new low with the dramatically inert, painfully dull Breaking Dawn Part 1.",0
42033, The film is never as good as its parts -- some of which are very good indeed. But Keaton knows how to control the medium and establishes a palpable mood without getting all artsy. It's a good start.,1
25880," Jenkins creates many remarkable scenes, particularly as the male characters discuss the racist realities with which they live.",1
73885," Successfully caps off a trilogy of intelligent, adrenaline-fueled espionage thrillers that raised the bar for the genre and made an action hero out of Matt Damon.",1
36349, Here's a leaden affair with some lovely visuals and colorful gowns that seem just picked up from the dry cleaners. What's strange here is that the joy of Boccaccio's sagas still seep through: his high veneration of both love and sex in equal measure.,0
59882," Jeff Bridges is rough and rowdy marshal Ruben ""Rooster"" Cogburn, and manages to put his own stamp on the role made famous in 1969 by John Wayne. It's no surprise that he knows how to bring a wide palette of colors to this character, and he seems to be...",1
55631, There's a ton of great actors in this movie and it makes it so fun to watch. It's just a group of hilarious people being hilarious together. ,1

55662," The flood rises, the night grows murky, and it becomes clear that the more water there is on screen, the less room there is for anything of interest to happen.",0
76390, It's an exceptional Australian film that will lurk in the shadows of your memory for a long time afterwards.,1
13132," Let's not mince words here, or hem and haw and add caveats about a few laughs or good intentions: You Don't Mess With the Zohan is astonishingly, impressively, depressingly bad.",0
54064," Jodie Foster's The Beaver had its moments, but the overall premise just didn't fly. I just couldn't buy the idea of the talking puppet.",0
50215," Chandor keeps Margin Call visually and emotionally fluid, staging the entire ordeal like an escalating disaster in which fiscal, rather than physical, violence is the looming threat",1
24397," Glazer keeps the movie engaging and moving for all ages, making sure a tender story is preserved for its big screen adaptation. Those on the hunt for an amiable production just might find plenty to like here.",1
69365," The action scenes are surprisingly good and the comedy has its moments, but the script leans too heavily on McKinnon to provide levity without always giving her much to work with.",0
79101," A fondly nostalgic Gothic horror movie in which director Guillermo del Toro delivers plenty of elegant chills while trying to supress a cheeky grin, luxuriating in the clammy, spooky-scary conventions of the genre.",1
58787," Destined to be a cult classic as a vicious, brilliant, and disgusting horror film...",1
32038," Oddly underpowered, anticlimactic and torpidly acted ...",0
29282," While technically proficient, overall House on Willow Street is much ado about nothing, making it another piece of low budget genre fiction hard to get excited about and even more difficult to recommend.",0
7356," ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" stays with you long after you've watched it, like a vaguely troubling but beautiful dream.",1
11650, It's a strong effort that unfortunately lacks punch and seems unsure of exactly what it's supposed to be.,1
83829," O Brother, Where Art Thou? is the Being John Malkovich of the year 2000. The most remarkable thing about it is just how any sane studio executive agreed to back it.",1
54882, Spanish actor Javier Bardem should leave audiences gasping with his stone-cold performance in the blood-spattered saga No Country For Old Men.,1
59960," Each actor plays an actor playing the sci-fi characters. It's a bit difficult to keep track of who's who, and ultimately the characters are so underdeveloped it's even more difficult to care.",0
128," Alex Garland beautifully subverts cliches of both fantasy and horror genres, making a film that gets under the skin to properly freak us out",1
8953," Has many fine performances ... yet the movie fails to give meaning to their actions, or to evoke sympathy for their anti-hero attitudes.",0
36898, Everyone got into the spirit of the movie (no pun intended) and made a cute film.,1
31588, Emmerich would be better off losing the pretense of respectability and embracing the B-movie showmanship that is clearly his strength.,0
25415, Here was a gripping tele-movie ready to be told from all perspectives - a figment of a scriptwriter's imagination. Not Renee Chignall's account.,0
79877," Newell retains the core elements of the story and key characters as well as the authentic elements of the period, but still manages to make the film a fresh experience",1
71205, Unbelievably dumb and sentimental movie.,0
76197," Freeman gives a strong and dignified performance, seeming far more heroically presidential than any of our recent presidents.",1

63764," As my son says, 'The books were a lot better.'",0

18783, Bafflingly unbalanced.,0
67195," The Forbidden Kingdom may be nothing but disposable fun, but it is a great, heaping, overflowing helping of fun. If you're 10, it may also seem like Citizen Kane.",1
8564," Now 80 himself, the right age, Hopkins is at home in Lear's skin. Shouty, angry, cruel one moment; vulnerable, tender, loving the next - or at the same time. A mesmerising performance.",1
60996," Just loud, boorish frat-boy wish-fulfilmment stuff, festooned with wink-wink celebrity cameos.",0
65811," Director Lewis, like his script, works to keep us unbalanced.",1
51914," Fascinating, perplexing and infuriating in equal measure, this spectacular example of dreamlike filmmaking deserves to be approached with an open -- or opened -- mind. Every aspect is ambiguous, but the rewards are there.",1

77146," If the film's pop-psychedelic noodling about fate, self-determination and the power of love looks muzzy-headed on closer consideration, its dense barrage of images richly repays second and third viewings.",1
75177," Story of three generations has sex, murder, drug use. ",1
18603," It quickly puts every other animated film from this year to shame. And unlike all those pretenders to the throne, 'Frozen' is a comedy that is actually funny, as well as endearing. ",1
8782," Filmed in black and white with a light, jazzy score courtesy of Gruff Rhys, Set Fire To The Stars offers a slice of biographical remembrance without a great deal of substance.",1
10700," Full of long stretches with no dialogue, giving the film a very high nod-off factor.",0

6232," Ultimately, Speed Racer comes down to the lesson your parents taught you: Despite the flash, looks aren't everything.",1
73873, [Tulip Fever is] lush and boisterous and crammed with the sort of arts gossip and commerce trivia that go nicely with gilded frames and talk of tulip futures.,1
24593," The 11th Hour made me realize that what's wrong with ""preaching to the choir"" isn't the intention to fire up a political base. It's the preaching.",0
19101," The star filmmaker, oft mocked for verging on self-parody, keeps his Teutonic explorer persona in check and allows his subjects' emotional outpourings-sadness, shame, dread, and desperation, and unexpected glimmers of hope and happiness-to set the tone.",1

22705, A commendable example of the sort of movie we once loved and then outgrew.,1

72759, The movie plays like Love Actually with half the brains and none of the nerve.,0
74677," I'm a pretty big Welles geek, so I enjoyed the experience anyway... but I can't imagine this will enlighten anyone who just wanders in off the street.",1
42693," ""Death Wish"" is a catechism for an audience terrified that their firepower and their influence are dwindling.",0

61409, Makes you glad you live when you do.,1
36535, The problem with the new film is that Ice Cube is too cool for the plot's nonsense. The faulty house and McGinley's behavior never inspire him to blow his top.,0
22498," The Spiderwick Chronicles, while not without its virtues (including a genuinely sweet ending), goes too far on the frightening front, especially for a young audience.",0
36107, ...a hopelessly corny romantic comedy that boasts a myriad of jokes and gags that wouldn't pass muster on the hackiest of sitcoms.,0
8364," This is a film about emotion, full of heart and compassion, and with plenty of pleasures in store.",1
48289," Cho and Penn are winning leads and play well off of each other. When the film works, it's often due to their interaction.",1
39370, [Taymor's] reach exceeds her grasp for a good half of its two-hour and 10-minute running time. But the other half is breathtaking,1
57227," A pass. Although the film could have been much funnier if it had been allowed to be edgier, Carell and Fey turn out to be a believable couple of marrieds...",1
29261, Could never get over the tired script.,0
34095," ""Elles"" has a surprisingly deep performance in a disappointingly shallow movie.",0
44691, Witherspoon... does the best she can with her unforgiving role... but no one could get us honestly past the notion that we're meant to take all these characters as delightfully oddball when they are quite clearly pathological.,0
49838, Timothy Spall - best known to mainstream audiences as Wormtail in the Harry Potter series - delivers an Oscar-caliber tour de force reminiscent of Charles Laughton,1
8569," A sad and, in the end, utterly sappy affair that recycles the same checklist of tropes that lulls audiences into thinking they are watching an edgy comedy.",0
38836," A frank, spare, but ultimately heartbreaking movie.",1
62053," In terms of enjoying it on the basis of pure showmanship, it's perhaps the most effective musical transition to the big screen since this current movie musical mini-revival began.",1
10077," Both Pattinson and DeHaan could have used more to do, but both actors put in performances that elevate the proceedings.",1
80180, Will go down in film history as an ambitious failure.,0
61074," It seems to be a case of everyone thinking that the subject matter is so very interesting and unusual that it's all the film needs. To some degree, that's true, but that mentality threatens to turn the into My Big Fat Spanking Wedding.",1
53518," An adaptation with grace, ease and, everything is said, in the most obvious way imaginable. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
21107," It succeeds more often than it fails, and it proves once and for all that M. Night Shyamalan is nobody's one-trick pony.",1
1696, Star Joel Murray is SO good and Bobcat finds the sharp edge of his satirical gift often enough to warrant a look. ,1
71731," [I]f you're expecting any savour of fin de siecle feminism more bracing than that peddled in, say, Nine to Five (which has much the same fundamental revenge premise), you'd be better off perusing the writings of Gloria Steinem.",0
77482," For the most part, The Wolverine succeeds at being an improvement over the last solo outing for the clawed superhero. But it's not much better.",0
43189, The movie is naturally thick with CGI. But Gunn uses the digital effects to create scenes of striking beauty.,1
60459," What the film offers is melodrama, more interested in the aviatrix's bedroom activities than her spirit. Amelia hunts for complexity, but it only achieves a tedious middle ground.",0
67116," Man From Reno is hardly the equal of its inspirations, but it nonetheless makes for a pleasantly mellow, well-structured concoction.",1
46001, This remake plays like the high school version of a big Broadway stage show. Although that's probably unfair to high school theater. ,0
80008," Rajma Chawal does a far more commendable job of capturing the wicked passion of Delhi than most films, but it can't capture the passion of its people.",0
67844, Lots of good stuff here. Winocour will go on to make even stronger films.,1
53566," An engrossing and deeply felt documentary that proves, once again, that love conquers all.",1
51280," It's short on jokes and hampered by unmemorable musical numbers (including one about building a boat), and the film's niceness can't overcome the dopey tedium.",0
58516," The problem is that both lead characters are interminably dull, with the camera's gaze repeatedly dwelling on their mundane private moments and imploring us to be intrigued.",0
31725, We just want the movie to ride off in the sunset to rest among all the other disappointing westerns in Boot Hill.,0
70925," If what you really really want is a mindless hyperactive romp about a quintet of British songbirds with flippy hair, flirty costumes, monster shoes and minute talent, then enter Spice World.",0
65506," There are better heist films, but none of them are showing at your local movie theater this month",1
6144," It will be interesting to see, now that this origin story is done and dusted, what Captain Marvel does next.",1
68841," Unless you're Rip Van Winkle and have been taking a nap for some time, only to awaken and exclaim - what economic crisis? - you've been made more than aware of it. Which renders this latest doc like the last horse over the finish line in Secretariat. ",0
77599," Despite its good intentions and some very strong acting, 'North Country' proves a frustratingly unsatisfying destination.",0
70754," a snore of a film whose sole positive accomplishment is teaching us a new word, trebuchet",0
77298, It actually manages to out-generic every Ashley Judd movie ever.,0

8409," He antagonized people, he galvanized people, and he mesmerized me even from beyond the grave thanks to Penn's and Van Sant's beautiful and inspiring work here.",1
45956," A witty, exciting and deeply moving masterpiece.",1
26120, Draggy stretches in the first few reels could easily have been pruned from an already tight 83-minute running time.,0
51225," More akin to 'Killer of Sheep' than 'Little Miss Sunshine,' a deliberately paced tone poem that's heavy on mood and light on plot.",1
28596," Using real experiences shared by the homeless in story workshops, Omotoso... directs with empathy and without sentimentality.",1
24612, Finding humor in this humorless situation is The Dilemma.,0
44749, The irreverent R-rated humor that made 2016's 'Deadpool' such a refreshing spin on the genre returns in this juiced-up deadpan sequel.,1
37024," On a technical level alone, Coraline is a stunning achievement and may just be the finest example of stop-motion animation yet put onscreen.",1
27910, A dweeby and unenchanting concoction as romantic comedies go.,0
7208," Watching Wonder, I felt as though someone had set off a sap bomb.",0
64564," The Lovely Bones is [Jackson's] most mature, self-assured and visually dazzling release.",1
38271, This cast deserves better than a faux-'70s action thriller. Tedious and forgettable.,0
13019, A fun movie with a ton of good comedic performances.,1
26252," As social insight, End of Watch is useless, but as engrossing entertainment, it's irresistible, thanks to Ayer's gift for dialogue, the relentless pacing set by film editor Dody Dorn, and gorgeous performances by Gyllenhaal and Pe√±a ...",1
56732," Not a single moment in this automotive snuff film isn't ridiculous, and its only mystery is why the estimable Ethan Hawke agreed to star.",0
833," The onscreen maturing of Adam Sandler continues with Click, perhaps the erstwhile frat boy's most sentimental outing yet.",0
6188," The enemy may have changed, but the same fatuous paranoia, flag-fluttering patriotism, and flimsy grip on international politics remains.",0

54490, A Bond movie that boldly struts forward while looking back over its shoulder to the past.,1
31659," There's a predictable plot, a few catchy songs and a shoe fight with Tyra Banks. In short: lazy but functional tween fare.",0
27434," The use of flipbook animation and exaggerated fantasy sequences entails a certain logic, but these devices run aground on a fairly limited sense of imagination which fails to make up for the story's essential slightness.",0
22519, It's more of a blunder than a wonder.,0
6927, One of [Godard's] most entertaining movies is also one of his most timeless.,1
46682, Violent to the point that to recommend this film to any Disney-loving kid would perhaps taint said child's opinion of the Mouse House for life.,0
68702," Amongst contemporary American filmmakers, it can only be said perhaps of Martin Scorsese alone that a good movie from him is a disappointment.",1
63914," An extremely well-made but rather muddle-headed film that delivers a solid blow to the belly, yet does not stand up to rigorous intellectual examination.",1
49938," Think of the film 'Catch Me If You Can' meets 'Ocean's Eleven' with a twist. The jewelry thief is an unsuspecting, sweet, and gorgeous Black woman by the name of Doris Payne.",1
1836," Sadly, ""Promised Land"" ... chooses to take the lazy road and simply become another member of the liberal posse that finds it easier to place a black hat on big business than to have an adult discussion about complex issues.",0

42358, Such a total disaster that it would have been an act of kindness for all concerned to have never released it.,0
67932," One of the best films of the year. However, Avatar's 'message' of human greed and unnecessary needs is nearly laughable considering the flick is one of the most expensive films of all time.",1
38023," A delicate heartbreaker about friendship, desire and the occasionally blurred line between the two.",1
28592, Spielberg has fashioned a timeless classic out of a horse's journey that powerfully and memorably becomes our journey as well.,1
22401," Without core chemistry, the already flimsy plot is unbelievable. Without any sexual tension, the fate of the Hudson-Dillon marriage is irrelevant. Without any reason for Wilson to cut up and caper, why watch him do it?",0
1447," ...generic, entirely uninvolving...",0
46498," The film is mostly sedate, without tension and with too much smolder.",0
58324," If this film doesn't put a smile on your face, you are too hard to please.",1

13953," Despite frequent declarations of his fixation with Salome, Pacino as both helmer and star fails to make clear the source of this obsession.",0
10407, Everyone involved should have known when to fold 'em. The movie is about as interesting as counting cards.,0
61166," Hitchcock/Truffaut is Kent Jones' meticulous work in which commentary and conversation overlap, charting the art of filmmaking.",1
56870," Despite this film's sharp dialog and terrific story, its bloated, undisciplined editing keeps it from being a classic.",1
19280," Every so often, a film comes along that redefines the boundaries of cinema. And every so often there is a movie about two middle-age men driving around and having lunch.",1
35395," Overall it's a satisfying, well-made, exciting, technically top-notch and scary movie.",1
72533," This plot leaves ample room for viewers to sweat the small stuff, like whether Trevor Nunn's score is more Marines ad or deodorant commercial.",0

59586, A welcome exercise in anime weirdness.,1
83644," To its credit, even the film realizes how ridiculous it is.",1
55853," The film serves a broad audience without exploiting the classic boxing tradition. ""Mind over matter"" may be age-old, but this one delivers it in a fun package.",1
53623," A dispiriting piece of consumerist comedy in which it's not the jokes that are priceless, but having the right credit card, the right outfit and the right boyfriend. It's a lose-lose.",0
21894," Arrival is one of the most intriguing movies I've seen in 2016 -- great acting, great premise.",1
18686, What begins as an eerie psychosexual horror movie slowly shifts to a haunting study of loneliness and female subjugation.,1
60764," Not a great movie, but it's a solid musical comedy with some guaranteed chuckles, a great cast, and an admirable wit.",1
43887," Beautiful movie beautifully done. This is stunning and MUST be seen on the big screen and not your small TV. In fact, the bigger the screen, the better and 3D if possible.",1
19838, I was surprised by how watchable I found it.,1
44351," The images may be truly breathtaking to behold, but cinema requires more than mere beauty. There is no there there, merely a vacant (if splendid) filmic vessel.",0
29321," While it is not a return to the classics, it still manages to bring a scary time. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
42528," This familiar material is pitched ever towards the ridiculous, but it's at least strongly played throughout. ",0
14544, There are far too many tokenistic soundtrack and cinematographic throws of the dice,0
82814," The overriding feeling with John Carter is that there is an epic film to be made from this material, but this just isn't it.",0
5923," Trank's origin story brings nothing new to the party, apart from a rather muted, real-world aesthetic that counters the colourful worlds dreamed up by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in the original Marvel comics.",0
19577," Narcissistic nonsense, styled within an inch of its life in the manner of food, fashion and travel magazines.",0
58490," It's unforgettable, as ravishing as anything Guadagnino's lazily captured in the italian countryside, as disturbing as any horror film you've seen this year. What Argento only pointed to, Gudagnino covers in viscera.",1
3716," In spite of the fact that I am obviously not operating on French director Claude Chabrol's wavelength, I enjoyed the film nevertheless.",1
79298, ... built on the reflection of abuse of political power in life's smallest details. [Full review in Spanish],1

12557, Never mind that it's already been done before and better; it's never been done this pretty.,0
26706," It's light entertainment meant to be shared, a big glass of summer fun that goes down easy.",1
36865, Just about everything in this pea-brained epic is overscaled and overwrought -- it's a cartoon trying to be a towering triptych. The dissonance between the film's heroic ambitions and its grindingly coarse treatment is rather amusing.,0
28775, Steven Spielberg's debut feature is a ripper,1
49541, More fun than you'd expect.,1
53067," After The Wedding could be the cinematic equivalent of a Coldplay song. And while that isn't necessarily a slam, it isn't a recommendation either.",0
7677, ...a gorgeously shot art film with striking imagery and solid performances...,1
69673, Torremolinos 73 successfully moves past the grainy closeups to show us love and even innocence.,1
71771," Watching a Solondz film has never been a particularly easy experience, yet Weiner Dog offers a droll playfulness not seen since Welcome to the Dollhouse.",1

34038," It oscillates between stale period piece and unengaging melodrama, coyly seducing viewers with the potential it fails to fulfill.",0
5374," It's a handsome production, but ultimately lacking in substance.",0
45954," Bale is barely recognisable as the balding, fat and aged politician, and charts Cheney's barely noticed rise to prominence with a restrained and masterful glower.",1
83945," As different as it would like to declare itself to be because of the gender switch, there isn't much to the Overboard remake that warrants a second shot on the big screen.",0
11761," Nick & Norah's tries to be the date movie for kids in skinny jeans and Cons. Thing is, it's too safe for their cynicism and while Cera and Dennings are pitch-perfect, even at 90 minutes it feels like a stretch.",1
64618," Why is Gracie as processed as an after-school special? You miss the knockabout edge of Bend It Like Beckham -- though the ending, in its Pavlovian sports-flick way, pumps you up.",0

46268," It might have set out to convey the disturbingly sadistic nature of institutional brotherhood, but it's the familial variety with which ""Goat"" explores something ultimately more compelling.",1
55089," Alas, why couldn't one of these fab authors have helped the first-time writer and director Josh Boone pen some decent dialogue?",0
33931," The film's slow reveal of its fantastical elements, which evoke the erratic, dreamlike strangeness of folk tales, makes them all the more unsettling. ",1

23195," The movie offers tantalizing glimpses of the leaded glass windows, rich mosaic fabrics and cobbled streets immortalized in his work.",1
38960," A heady psychosexual drama that's steeped in dense anxieties and rich European glamour (the film was partially funded by Chanel), Olivier Assayas's latest finds the French auteur at the very top of his game.",1

19356," There is a lot to like in Gareth Huw Evans' ambitious folk horror tale, Apostle. The problem might be that there is just too much of everything to really fall in love.",1

1457," When an actor reaches a summit of unparalleled global popularity, it is probably hard to resist the temptation to play God.",0
78834," What really makes Inglourious Basterds stick out like a Royale with cheese...is its sheer playfulness. Tarantino does digress, as is his wont, but these are not the irritating indulgences they were in Kill Bill.",1

24903," Delivering humor, heart and a toy-filled adventure, Toy Story that Time Forgot is another wonderful, entertaining and playful installment to the Toy Story franchise. ",1
37376," By the time the film reaches its convoluted, bombastic and preposterous climax, any sense of real magic that it once conveyed has utterly vanished.",0
75635," The cinematography brings the danger to vivid life, as the sun blazes down on Honnold inching his way towards the goal. Seriously not for the faint of heart.",1
803," By film's end, audiences are bound to be left dissatisfied with the choppy and confusing storytelling style and unhappy about the missed opportunity.",0

2298," Knowing's path is so far fetched, disturbing and down right awful that I would expect to find very few people who enjoyed this film.",0
80671," Mostly fast-paced and fun, with the occasional choice gags skewering modern parenting techniques and supplying more smiles than expected.",1
30069," Clooney's obviously going for old-school charm and camaraderie here, but the first half of the film is so scattered, and the characters are so lacking in specifics, that a sense of group bravado never feels earned.",0

80792, A well made film about one messed up dude. ,1
31405," Wild is ... a visual tone poem. To try to impose any orthodox sensibility, much less political correctness, on the film is close to blasphemy ... something more than the ordinary miracle that is your average well-realized movie.",1

58044, Drifter showcases the talents of a confident director...,1
4442," One of the two or three best movies of the year, In America is easily the most emotionally satisfying.",1
3132," The humanization of these antiheroic outlaws doesn't feel forced, but it does feel engineered, and there's never a viewer investment to match the story's wide expanse.",0
25962, Captures something brainy and bullheaded about Mortensen that feels true.,1
10713," ... the teamwork is shoddy, the plays lack surprise and, finally, ""Juwanna Mann"" misses more than it hits. ",0
49579," There is applied elegance where there should be, but the film develops so ambiguously that at this point it's as cliche as the last scare in a 70s horror flick. [Full Review in Spanish]",0
21805," True, ""Knight and Day"" is preposterous nonsense. Just think of it as a spoof of one of Cruise's ""Mission: Impossible"" movies on crack.",1
27858," Once you admit that the Jane Austen depicted onscreen bears scant relation to any person named Jane Austen, living or dead, the film fulfills its purpose.",1
68925, A very funny movie about the very unfunny persistence of white supremacy in American culture.,1
61442," The whole experience is rough going: sometimes numbing, sometimes horrifying, sometimes merely baffling. There's a kind of artful artlessness at work here",1
70955," Unfortunately, the moments designed as comic relief become the main focus of the film, giving us cheap laughs that stray away from the main plot. [Full review in Spanish]",0

67993," Some brave publicist came up with the tagline ""Ideas separate us, dreams bring us together"" to sum up the spirit of Jean-Luc Godard's new film, his first in six years. Twelve months on and I'm still trying to figure out what it all might mean.",0

76023, The emphasis on computer-generated effects ultimately robs the movie of much of its energy.,0

80281, The dysfunctional script and operatically excessive direction ... land someplace closer to outsider art than bad moviedom.,0
76859," So magnificent, so powerful, that it hardly behooves mere words to tell of its heart-rending appeal, of its dramatic fire, its breath-taking battle shots in which men stab and kill each other, for the glory of war.",1
26229, It plays out in such a shockingly authentic way that we feel like we're right there. And what makes this film vitally important is the way it challenges us to examine ourselves without ever making a big statement.,1
52567," This sweet, well-made teenage rite-of-passage drama from Denmark militantly sticks to the tried-and-tested.",0
12506," A movie based on a recurring ""Saturday Night Live"" character? What could possibly go wrong with that?",0
32306, ...the film is a deeply effective and provocative look at the demands fame makes on women-but then Kaz shows up...and the whole thing turns into a rote love story.,1

42766," The characters are engaging, the effects are superb and the action sequences are inventive enough that the concept of being based on a board game actually pays off.",1
25383," The investigation and the clues that lead to the murderer are well thought out and continually provocative. As a narrative, the film is quite involving.",1
2329," Nothing in this film has the visceral or emotional impact that would make it more than an average thriller. It just goes through the bland, mass-produced motions.",0
9682, The only major change Disney's A Christmas Carol takes with the source material is draining the humanity right out of it.,0
83447, Viewers who watch with a curious mind rather than a hushed awe for His Goreness might have a few questions.,0
60468," The final 20 minutes of this B-movie reveal why a few talented people were interested in making it, but it's too little too late by that point.",0
82588," This soggy, uninspired entertainment seems to demonstrate that director Ben Younger, who did such a terrific job with the stock-swindle movie Boiler Room, doesn't have the chops for a comedy that's trying to be funny and perceptive.",0

11280," It's a handsome but frustrating watch, equal parts civics lecture and dark political farce, with all the lily-white gravitas England's acting community can offer. ",0
58100," Instead of building tension and suspense, It just jumps from scene to scares with no connection or coherence to thread them together other than the mere fact that they've been placed on top of one-another, like toys mixed up from different sets.",0
35177," The plot's a total shambles. The message (rob, pillage and snort your way to a no-consequences happy ending) stinks.",0
68723," After an intriguing and tense first half, the film becomes increasingly crazy, but Benson and Moorhead clearly have talent and we may well hear more from them in the future.",1
56881," The film's facile message of cross-cultural unity owes more to fairy tale than reality, but the action is slick and the story gripping.",1
41246, Chases. Explosions. Guns. Crashes. Wisecracks. Punches.,1
26371," Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, when they reached a certain age, played harridans and ax murderers. Diane Keaton has started playing mothers, but, alas, the effect is about the same: She's scary. Very scary.",0

79884," I won't tell you Taken is great, but it's great fun.",1
47051, [It's] about auto racing... but it's much more interesting in showing how two men compete with each other without losing their souls in the process. ,1

4745, An intricate and fascinating narrative.,1
67739," Leatherheads tries to be a screwball comedy, but it's more The Eleven Stooges.",0
73182, At long last a disaster movie that doesn't upset the randomness of suffering by compelling the heroes to save the world or the obnoxious side characters to meet their ironic comeuppance.,1

8441, Lobs nothing but clich√©s.,0
70679, Subplots subbing for a story line is an effort with little payoff.,0
6989," For all of its vices, I can't help but think that we've brought Getaway on ourselves. It's not the car chase film we need right now, but it's probably the car chase movie we deserve. And if the finale is any indication, a sequel could be ready to go.",0

16353, To call this film inventive is to grossly understate its accomplishment.,1

52707, A movie I am going to recommend to all of my friends and family.,1
19714," It's one quarter of a great movie. But, after its frightening opening act, the rest of the movie is remarkably ho hum and way too long. Still it's well worth seeing for its devastatingly intense first thirty minutes.",1
80032," The problems can be traced to a screenplay that is stuffed with internecine plot points and shades-of-gray complexities, but little else: no character-sharpening details and none of the wit and charm that buoyed Casino Royale.",0

56149," Utterly lacking the drive and roller-coaster energy expected of top action pics, this latest try at repackaging Speed is a Kmart version of a Jerry Bruckheimer production.",0
20268," The movie may feel at times like a put-on, but it is in fact entirely sincere.",0

75811, Misses a golden opportunity by crossing the line that separates parody from stupidity.,0

60444," There's a dewy-eyed freshness to parts of ""Damsel"" that recall Westerns from the 1970s, only with tongue placed more firmly in cheek. With its spiffy production values and game cast, the film has a lot going for it.",0
67992, ...you might find some utility at a cocktail party discussing the finer points of puppet eroticism.,1
47090," It's a good thing the dogs are as adorable as they are, because there's not much going on around them.",0
5832, The major problem with this film is that we never see what the leads do in their sexual partners other than physical specimens and the lack of believability at the core of Adore leaves it lame. ,0
72295," Aroonpheng's background as a cinematographer and painter is clearly in evidence in the film, which is a visual feast whose striking images are serene while in continuous motion-like water rippling in a canal. ",1

64036, It sounds heavygoing but if anything Amreeka is a little too sweet and cosy for its own good.,1
14672," The Childhood of a Leader is a dark, enigmatic piece of work that hovers between visionary greatness and petty domestic triviality. Corbet's inaugural stint behind the camera marks a stunning debut.",1

46781, Randy flirtations and elaborate masquerades to evade the sanctimonious powers-that-be are the cornerstone of this exuberant film.,1

11006, The film's rapid changes of tone often make for a bumpy ride.,1
18455," An acerbic, darkly comic critique of how social conventions can lead people into false, sterile and emotionally stunted lives, American Beauty is a real American original.",1
37774," More annoyingly bland than genuinely awful. However, the presentation of its cute-as-a-button star is genuinely, absolutely, immeasurably awful.",0

65924," ""A very tense and engrossing thriller...""",1
63970," It cashes in on trendy retroism--the remedial, brash distant second cousin to nostalgia--instead of utilizing the perspective of, to borrow from Joni Mitchell, seeing clowns from both sides now.",0
18393, Taken as a whole -- two movies and a handful of trailers -- Grindhouse is pure popcorn fun.,1
72900, Now the big question is pretty simple: was David Seltzer's screenplay any better than Dan McDermott's? The answer is for the most part no.,0
20306," a boring movie full of mockable dialogue, dreadful acting and long, supposedly poetic narration which could induce a coma if you don't have enough caffeine flowing through your veins.",0
44419," This sense of temporal suspension, enhanced by a slight fuzziness to the cinematography, is the fim's most endearing quality. Otherwise it's nothing more than a soggy tale of redemption in the face of mortality. ",0

80161, It all adds up to an epic pop artefact of indescribable soullessness.,0
43143, The characters are so one-note and unlikable that most viewers will find themselves looking forward to their grisly demises because it means that they won't be annoying us anymore.,0
4336," Director Pablo Larra√≠n's Jackie is a powerful if traumatic achievement, in approach as well as execution. So is Natalie Portman's performance in the title role.",1
47753, Director Michael Cuesta does an admirable job with a capable cast.,1

4679, Cut 30 minutes and re-edit and there may be an interesting PBS program here.,0
57340," The worst crime of a film like this is that not only is it retarded, it expects its audience to be retarded as well.",0
37552," For those seeking an afternoon weepy, the film's poise might be its Achilles heel - we never feel the howl of real heartbreak. But for everyone else, two words will suffice: pure class.",1
24963," It's difficult to not feel like a lot of ""Batman v Superman"" is an exhaustive - and expensive- effort from DC and Warner Bros. to catch up to Disney and Marvel's well-oiled cinematic universe. ",1

40956," One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout, but a hundred of them can be numbing. Proof of this is Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever.",0
60025," The comin'-at-ya effects are certainly state of the art ... but any hopes that the film might blaze new trails are squashed the first time someone picks up a paddleball. Kids should lap it up; for anyone else, Dramamine is advised.",1
20164," The latest animated Shrek adventure may be in 3-D, but its execution is flat.",0
65115," Disappointing thriller that's let down by a tedious script, a frankly ridiculous final act and some dodgy overacting by Kevin Spacey.",0

47432, Dumb and Dumber To is exactly the Dumb and Dumber sequel that we deserve.,0
46810, An unconvincing replica of the dizzy situation comedies that Hollywood poured out in double and triple bills in the thirties and forties (and went on making in the guise of TV sitcoms well into the nineties).,0
10968," With its commercial imperatives and subversive ambitions working at cross purposes, this puzzling movie doesn't have a clue what it's all about.",0

67033," All of these characters are more interesting when things are going badly for them than when the tide has turned, and Carroll's determination to make the final reel an extended bout of audience tummy tickling is disappointingly conventional.",0
13179," Catch it on HBO for the sheer delight of everything Hoffman and Streisand do. It's fun to meet the Fockers themselves, but the rest of the movie can stay home.",0

10102," Often drags and should have been retitled as The NeverEnding, Painfully Unfunny Story. It falls on its face both a comedy and as a satire with a lazy, asinine and mean-spirited script. Even the outtakes don't induce any real laughs.",0
26179, It's never less than watchable and the beautifully choreographed brutality of the final pay-off is worth the wait.,1
21679," There are many unintentionally funny moments in a movie that wants to be taken seriously but is derailed by listless direction, tired acting, and a corny script.",0
81740, Lowe and Oram's script balances nimbly on the thread of razor wire between horror and farce...,1

83611," [A] bloodless, bland spookfest riddled with empty 'gotcha!' moments.",0
83493," As much as Never Sorry reveals about its central subject, it reveals just as much about the place where he lives, and the way demands for freedom find methods to limbo under oppression.",1
70338," Cyrus is heartening: as a genuinely charming romance, as an opportunity for a leading man who doesn't get enough such breaks, and as a calling card for the Duplasses, who have hit the ball quite hard on their first at-bat in the majors.",1

41900," Even if The Ledge couldn't be written off as a hollow polemic, there's also the lifeless drama, laughable dialogue, chintzy sets, and poor lighting to grapple with.",0
54310," There's a clear thematic debt to such character-driven 1970s classics as Serpico or The French Connection, but Destroyer also feels profoundly contemporary in its flipping of traditional gender roles.",1
79486," Unfocused and uninspired, Night School has its moments but is held back by a script that required more study.",0

2725," Over-written and awkwardly directed, it's nevertheless family-friendly, complete with flying lizards and a flatulent sea lion.",0
7545, Once Koler's charm begins to wear thin it's easy to become frustrated by a story that has the potential to be so much more than a light romantic frolic.,0
47572," ""The Guilt Trip"" is one more example of everything wrong with the Hollywood movie machine. ",0
51872, One thing's for sure: this expos√© ain't deep.,0
56212," With its probing script by David Hare, painterly camerawork by Chris Menges and Roger Deakins, confident direction by Stephen Daldry and impeccable supporting performances, every frame of the movie screams filmmaking excellence.",1
52892," McDormand brings a Chaplinesque pathos to this snappy period comedy. Fabulous frocks, tasty men, female bonding, art deco apartments to die for; it's like Sex And The City set in 1930s London. I could have happily watched it for hours...",1
14792," For all of its intermittent, crowd-pleasing charm, oenophiles (and cinephiles, for that matter) might be better off putting their money toward a good bottle of Robert Mondavi.",0
74626," By film's conclusion, Drillbit is a mock hero at best, and the few bits of comedy have been overshadowed by viciousness.",0
17376," Well, it's a more fun trip to Rio than Rio. As the reckless flailing of a lot of meatheads, Fast Five is essentially a food fight with sloppy Joes.",1
74555, By the end of the film it's still impossible to tell whether he's been wronged or whether the last decade has taken its toll on his sanity.,1

3047," Whether audiences laugh at or with them, the motley denizens of Preston, Idaho, and Napoleon Dynamite seem poised to win a devoted fan base.",1
63093," Film doesn't suit Alan Partridge as well as other media, but Coogan and company have nevertheless delivered a consistently lively satirical comedy that would stand on its own merits[.]",1
79882," Like the best dreams always do, it ends with a jolt, but its ideas and images linger like dust in sunlight.",1
64416," ""Winter's Tale"" wants to be a magical romance that leaves you feeling like the universe is full of secret purpose, but instead it's convoluted, over-narrated and deeply silly.",0

76951, McAnuff and screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan seem unable to get the story and the satire to co-exist.,0
49324, Damon and Blunt are great--it's just a shame they don't have a stronger adversary for their love.,1

21188," Oh 10 Things, how I loathe thee, let me count the ways.",0
74758," GRACIE clearly was made with affection and was meant to serve as an inspirational story, but the reliance on trite and overused images undercuts its message.",0
66367, Enemy wants so much to be profound and provocative that it fails to ground itself in any way.,0
6762," Not surprisingly, Witherspoon nails it with a performance that's just the right blend of heartfelt and calculating-she's brainy, funny, self-exposing, and well on her way to an Oscar.",1
3653, The cast saves this typical George Sidney tasteless mess.,1
41655," Aided by solid performances, this offbeat comedy lives up to its title, though it could have stepped a little farther out on the ledge.",1
12163, A routine but reasonably diverting B-movie about a conscience-stricken hit man and the girl he opts not to kill.,1
73615," Overall, it's a pretty irritating movie. But as I watched it, almost in spite of myself, I kept getting caught up in Young's music.",0
19284," A film about the sowing of revolution designed for the approval of bourgeois gentlefolk -- for the very type of person that Che, once one himself, would not think twice about putting a bullet into.",0

38778," Like a Botoxed face, the movie never shows an interesting wrinkle or passion-attesting lifeline.",0
63629," There's a haunting starkness to [Michael] Pearce's direction and bleak poetry in his tricky, icky story, which starts out as a psychological drama before branching out into horror and is dominated by Buckley's quivering intensity.",1
18023," If Judd Apatow is the Jesus of modern comedy, Seltzer and Friedberg are the Anti-Christ - and sadly just as prolific",0
26624, Bully feels too diffuse and simplistic to really do this topic justice.,0
6537," While it seems obvious that small children will delight to the relentlessly broad hijinks, the film is essentially a dead zone of comedic set-pieces and contrived situations.",0

21111, The Extra Man is a grating one-note comedy posing as something more.,0
83955, Vivid in detail and wrenchingly well acted...,1
68755," Throughout Rothe gives it a right go, despite being stuck in a movie that is never certain of what it's trying to be, or when it's going to end. ",0
36608, There's nothing wrong with a one-joke horror/comedy -- provided you keep the joke spinning for 90 minutes. This flick (somehow) does.,1
18282," Akerlund's shock tactics-brain matter, blood spatter, and realistic-sounding howls of pain-are neither shocking nor thoughtful.",0
20126," Even in down seasons, a Thursday block of ""The Office"" and ""30 Rock"" delivers better writing, tighter direction and more laughs than 88 minutes of ""Date Night."" For free.",0

33404," The Last Jedi is a sample of what Disney intends to do with this franchise, turning it into a product full of cliches, empty plots, forgettable villains, [and] one-dimensional characters. [Full Review in Spanish]",0
36196, It's hard not to be swept along.,1
79800," Mr. Klapisch lingers his camera lovingly over shots of grapes being harvested and stomped, all the while employing story mechanics and flashbacks indelicate enough to suggest the churn of a factory juicer.",0
22000," The movie is a noble enterprise, and Downey is stupendous as usual, but Joe Wright's direction is too slick to elicit much feeling.",0
69808," This silly, satirical comedy glides in, skating on thin ice.",0

2730," The good, Will Smith is a brilliant actor. The bad, Seven Pounds isn't nearly as brilliant as Will Smith.",0
26908," From start to finish, Brewer's remake exudes the look and style of its forebearers: semi-awkward dance choreography, clunky dialogue and an obedience to formula that borders on clich√©. But somehow, it works.",1
46317, An occasionally fascinating but ultimately undercooked portrait of the young and disaffected.,0
59093," While individual actors can be amusing, especially among supporting players, ""I Give It a Year"" is thoroughly tone deaf. I wouldn't give it five minutes. ",0
53451," Like the mutant progeny, Splice is an unsuccessful hybrid: half moral fable, half mad scientist makes monster flick. ",0
67267," I don't know what Brewer wanted to capture. There are too many close-ups of stomping, swinging feet to suggest he cared about great choreography.",0
67345," Quick as a flash and just as substantial, the sequel to 2005's Hoodwinked aims to one-up the fairy tale universe and cultural references of Shrek in one go.",1
52942," Results wants to seduce and charm by roughing up the rom-com formula but, way too often, it drags and annoys.",0
26949," ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a cant-miss idea that misses every target.",0

64039, Here are two things that definitely don't go together: baseball and piano music.,0
59568," Ron may be an idiot, but Anchorman is no dope.",1
53358, A playful and often infuriating comedy about the impulsive things people do in reaction to something unexpected,1
44832, It plays even worse than it sounds.,0
50403," At a swift 73 minutes, the film certainly zips by and there's some crisp cinematography on show but as quickly as it ends, it also disappears from the mind.",0
49783," Okay, it's not that bad. But it's close.",0
44365," Jackie Chan shows his age, and that he's not much of a dramatic actor, in this hackneyed vengeance thriller. ",0
2223, Perhaps the madcap adventures of a love-lorn middle aged man is not exactly kid's stuff. But it sure isn't for the adults in the audience either.,0
83524," Cox finds himself doing a poor imitation of Martin Scorsese, channeling the manic hedonism of both ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" minus the seductive magnetism of either film's central performance.",0
41326," Stripped of the novel's kudzu-like excess, the story loses its timeless, nightmarish, existential power and becomes another cautionary tale in which beautiful and privileged post-9/11 young people learn the world is no longer safe for Americans.",0
80035, Arbitrage overcomes some pulpy plot twists and a little anti-corporate sermonizing to become a brisk tale of a financial wizard whose sins have returned to collect a debt.,1
26317," a soap opera for people who don't watch soap operas; Dawson's Creek for those who scoff at the prospect of watching James van der Beek, Katie Holmes and - yes - Michelle Williams, shooting the pop culture breeze.",0
74374," With a stellar cast including Val Kilmer and Jon Voight, Heat has it all including a great soundtrack full of tone-setting, ambient, and symphonic arrangements.",1
27758," Has a surprisingly measured pace, its set pieces choreographed with a deliberateness at odds with the frantic nature of Snake's quest. ",1
21242," Though a mediocre movie, it's seriously funny, relishing in the sophomoric, occasionally shocking, and devoted silly.",1
44972," Laborious, remote and strangely uninvolving.",0
53541," There's no drive to it, aimlessly meandering around New York trying to prove a point when there isn't one. ",0
82827," Aloha is a mostly bad, uneven film with hard-to-know characters and a baffling premise.",0

549," I'll bet most 'Pirates' fans will defend this final chapter, yet realize it has reached the end of its usefulness.",0
69486," Good despite the poster-blurb title. I hear the sequels are ""Best Family Movie Yet"" and ""Amazing Thrill Ride!""",1
69171," All the elements are in place to create a compelling film for contemporary audiences, not just for those in the industry or those affected by sexual abuse. ",1
62903," Baywatch ain't great, but after such duds as that King Arthur clunker and the latest Jack Sparrow droppings, you could do worse than a day at the beach.",1

10055, Call me. I'll see it again with you this weekend.,1
64132, This potentially intriguing exploration of the sharp angles of brotherhood is diluted into something altogether more generic.,0

82686," Full of heart, warmth and enough excrement to fill an all-white bridal shop.",1
8588," This is a gruelling film and one that survivors of sexual violence should watch with caution, but it is a tremendously powerful piece of cinema.",1
21034, A movie that never provides a compelling argument for its own existence.,0
51910," '7 Days in Hell' is a funny diversion, with some great moments. But like so many of the SNL sketches it resembles, it's too chummy with its targets to punch as hard as it should.",1
66614, A stringent street psychodrama in which brutality is an infection and every male is a carrier.,1
76587, This infectious jazz doco will leave you feeling a little more content than Whiplash.,1

60569, Nothing this potentially dangerous should be this tedious to sit through.,0
22862, Jeunet's optical sleights of hand would be hollow if he also didn't create dozens of vivid and frequently lovable characters.,1
83264, Minus a lot of laughs for children Pixar's beautiful animation alleviated by Michael Giacchino's magnificent music transports us to a far away make-believe place in the blink of an eye.,1
60386," Wonderfully funny, terribly touching and a vehicle-with comically dilapidated vehicles-for the boundless gifts of Maggie Smith.",1
76440," Song to Song is slightly less pretentious than Malick's last film, the 2015 sigh of ennui Knight of Cups, though it features just as many miniature actresses.",0
71469," Believe in forgiveness comes dropping slow on the characters, in the form of a snowfall that's possibly redemptive, but also cold.",1
27051," Just say 'Burgermeister Meisterburger' to anyone over 30, and watch 'em giggle. We all know this story...",1
32182, A more personal approach would have elevated Patriots Day from a solid effort to retell a familiar story to a deep and moving reminder of the kind of personal damage that comes with this kind of tragedy.,0
69135," It is as if [Frank] trashes the entire mechanism altogether, resulting in a spoonfed conclusion, rewarding facile expectations and violating the integrity of his film's well-established structure.",0
10329," Bujalski knows how to reveal the immaturities and hangups people hide behind money, ambition, and the pursuit of a better body.",1
30546, The production values are wonderful (due in large part to the work of Animatronic Puppeteers and Jim Henson's Creature Shop) and the script is quick and funny.,1
21161, ...marginally better than its predecessor in much the same way that being shot through the head is better than being guillotined...,0
53628," This might not have the strong sentimental story that we've seen in previous Pixar films, but it is as cute, clever, and funny as ever.",1
82301," A wham-bam actioner, but its pointed political subtext ensures Damon and Greengrass deliver their most provocative mission yet.",1
36186," One part unconvincing, jingoistic war picture and one part melodramatic, preachy hogwash.",0
43135, Bites off less than it can chew.,0

46207," With pieces this familiar, the only thing that matters is if they're moved energetically toward a really good payoff. And in its final third, Confidence generates the puzzle-solving satisfaction of The Spanish Prisoner.",1
61819, What's really shocking is that a talented director like Varma has used a real-life tragedy to produce Bolly-gore porn while passing it off as serious cinema.,0
53699," A dumb, gorgeous popcorn chomper with a fabulous cast, for what it's worth, Angels and Demons is more enjoyable than its zillion-dollar sire, but that doesn't mean it's actually any good.",0
3175," In the Mouth of Madness is another marvelous work of art by John Carpenter, albeit a lesser known work. ",1
36402," The capable cast can only do so much to disguise the thin, predictable, paranoid survival thriller they're trapped playing out.",0
16168, Director Billy Wilder's technique of photographing Third Avenue in the grey morning sunlight with a concealed camera to keep the crowds from being self-conscious gives this sequence the shock of reality.,1
19090, Do not be surprised to see Amelie pull a Crouching Tiger and be nominated as both best foreign film and best film.,1
71148, Another pat and predictable cautionary tale which nonetheless manages to push the right emotional buttons. That's the magic of the Tyler Perry genre.,1

50889," A compelling look at the relationships between fathers and sons, and the child coming to terms with the parent's mortality.",1
30174, Blades of Glory is only slightly less funny -- if you ask ignorant old me -- than watching real figure skating. It's your coin.,0
65528," This heroin drama falls flat in execution. It's drama is overwrought, as it constantly tries to stay one step above a low grade Lifetime movie.",0
40236," Lots of visual gags, lame slapstick humour and hopefully no more sequels.",0

69709," Never quite the sum of its parts, this would-be intelligent thriller coasts by on strong supporting performances from Giamatti, Sewell and Biel.",0
14170," They Remain's greatest strength is that it manages to sustain a relatively high level of tautness. Besides the characters and acting, Gelatt accomplishes this through cutting from one scene to the next abruptly.",1
83187, Thomas Vinterberg and Lars von Trier take another step toward intellectual bankruptcy with a pretentious film about a group of pacifists obsessed with handguns.,0

59521," If Santa Claus had a fever dream fueled by figgy pudding indigestion and an egg nog bender, his subsequent Yuletide hallucinations would probably look tame compared to Disney's aggressively opulent phantasmagoria.",0

57306, A first rate film with an outstanding cast...,1
33825, The most crowd-pleasing unfilmable novel ever made.,0

68679, So-so drama about pregnant women with very different lives.,0

2059," Pray that Peter Jackson doesn't tackle the ""Foundation"" series next.",0
13756, The mood will be too mild and shock-free for fans of Todd Solondz or early Neil LaBute; yet the film is sufficiently cool and quizzical to make you wonder where Lawson will turn next.,1

51621, Ava DuVernay has gone from Selma to sellout. ,0
64985," Perhaps the director set the bar so high with A History of Violence that there was no way he could equal it with Eastern Promises, but for him to fall so far short is nothing less than criminal.",0
61237, The Benefactor is a character portrait in search of a movie.,0
27142," A totally enthralling movie that despite using well-worn themes seems totally fresh. Beautiful to behold and always witty, this is what I would have nominated as best film of 2010 had I seen it in time.",1
83426," Writer David Harrower and director Benedict Andrews treat the material as circumspectly as possible, but their approach doesn't prevent the film from losing a tremendous amount of steam after its first act.",0
41993," In the future, maybe Bay should abandon using a screenwriter altogether and just fill up 90 minutes with disconnected images of robo-carnage.",0
67420," It's the chemistry between Domhnall Gleeson and newcomer Will Tilston, as the awkwardly matched father and son, that makes the movie more than a m√©lange of inept parenting and Tigger too.",1

48788, We're left with little to do but admire the scenery.,0
20664," Gibson proves he's still not to be messed with in a film that reasserts him as a sturdy, if rather grizzled leading man. A pity, though, this required Campbell to cookie-cut his masterly '80s TV series into a formulaic actioner.",1
50165," Suicide Squad is likely to be good enough for some, but it's by no measure good. It's a smattering of recognizable faces and costumes in an otherwise incoherent, listless story.",0
15869," A good piece of cinema. It is far from perfection, and far from the heights reached by its two predecessors, but it still can entertain the audience -- not just the children who would enjoy Ewoks.",1

31670," That bare outline doesn't even begin to capture the sheer wild ambition, beauty and savagery on show in The Revenant. Far more challenging than even I√±√°rritu's bravura Oscar-winner Birdman, this is his Fitzcarraldo or his Apocalypse Now.",1

65810," The only thrill, and it's worth the price of admission, is Bening.",1
38252," There is initial tension but halfway through, Foster takes a wrong turn, and what ensues is a meandering thriller disguised as social satire. What a waste of her all-star cast.",0

13446, Its highlight comes in a cunning series of cuts that fade between fellatio performed at gunpoint with genuflection at the foot of a crucifix.,1
25306," At the end of this nearly three hour movie, what you have is a noble attempt thwarted by uneven artistic choices.",0
19258," The movie is a strong reminder of the freedom of youth and the quest for pure adventure, one that looks to the stars and sees the possibilities are as bright as a child's own imagination.",1
16612," For a big dumb production about a movie monster smackdown, Alien vs. Predator is a surprisingly good time.",1
33432," Between its tired, cliche-ridden target and its cast of tiresome characters, a better title for this Belgian import would have been Everybody's Fatuous!",0

65241," Transferred from the stage, Cranston's performance remains outsized, but probably proportionate to Johnson himself.",1
42901," This latest, more mature installment in the ""prince"" of franchises should prove to be one of the strongest, as better plotting, pacing, effects and always delicious Brit cast tempt more elders to join the kid masses.",1
73639, Holiday-themed show will give Trolls fans the warm fuzzies.,1

65866," Though loved by critics, this unique comedy has not found an audience.",1
65012," There are several bad words that could be used to describe Bad Words. Since most of the ones used in the movie aren't fit to print here, let's go with uninspired, humorless, belabored, pointless, monotonous, and irritating",0
60737," Though these stories have little to do with each other, all are gripping, and you watch the last third of ""Spinning Plates"" rapt.",1
49611," Rather than catching Feast during its limited midnight-movie theatrical release, one can enjoy comparable B-movie goofiness via any Saturday-night Sci-Fi Channel offering.",0

35140," ...while not following the same playbook of the first two, [Part III] is an equally lazy, unfunny slog that fails to even indulge in the raunchy excesses these guys are known for.",0
56139," Rihanna's performance is an encapsulation of the entire film. It has style, imagination and energy to burn. But disappoints when it comes to dialogue, pacing and plot.",1
67052," This is a great endorsement of Eubank to take on larger films in the future. Should he get his hands on a more fleshed-out (and thought-through) screenplay, he may transform and adapt into a world class pop filmmaker.",1

65361, They've taken an old done to death plot and tried to make it modern by adding streams of profanity and sex talk; doesn't work.,0

71539, Sabaah Folayan's first film documents the rise of a political movement from the ground level.,1
52561," It boils down to 83 minutes of Chev journeying through LA's ethnic 'hoods dispatching minorities. Granted the movie can't be taken seriously, its cavalier racism is shocking.",0
23873, A lovely little dash of Hollywood hokum.,1
22611," The film tries to deliver a message about pacifism and being yourself to young kids, but the message it really delivers is that violence is OK as long as you have an excuse.",0
46325, Some of the best work Disney has done in at least a decade.,1
36488," Stuck on auto-pilot, and therefore, comes off as a tiresome excursion into terrain that has been covered too many times to count.",0

26020, Anyone worried that the Mouse House might take the edge off the franchise should take comfort in Rogue One being probably the grittiest entry since The Empire Strikes Back in 1980.,1
27433, Thirteen Ghosts is good scary fun for about 30 minutes.,0
67247," Amelia is a conventional, competent and often very pretty film; it's just never as interesting as the woman at its center.",0

25643," The somber tone conflicts with the far-fetched story line, sapping it of the energy it needs to effectively sell its twists and turns.",0
20142," Is the film good? Oh, definitely not. It is a trope-laden, visual mess with too much slow-mo and a dash of terrible CGI. It was a stupid, dumb movie that I loved wholeheartedly. ",1
38631, There are some big laughs here. But just as many huge silences.,0
75712," ... while the ending might be a foregone conclusion, getting there involves just enough slapstick manful idiocy to keep the humor moving at a clip.",1
2787," Despite the dense dust-caked atmosphere and a spiky, unnerving score by Antony Partos, Mich√¥d's film adds up to little more than existentialist moaning punctuated by the occasional gunfight.",0

32648," Get Smart is likable and very funny -- at least a two-to-one ratio of excellent gags to clunkers -- but it's not, for better or worse, Get Smart.",1
81079, The Guilt Trip is clearly targeted at older audiences less than receptive to the crude jokes that made Seth Rogen famous.,1
38332," As off-putting and obnoxious as it might be, at least admire the unique vision in this wacky musical comedy.",0
9736, I was completely underwhelmed by this movie.,0
24748," Chastain's performance feels too skittish, if not a little mad straight out of the blocks, playing into the hands of Strindberg's chauvinistic portrait of Julie, rather than challenging it.",0
26127," Chronologically organized and voiceover-free, the movie is a 145-minute patchwork of old concert footage and talking-head interviews -- lots and lots of them -- from people who knew, loved, and worked with the reggae giant.",1
8991," Mr. Basset is too enamored of the usual action film clich√©s ... But he has a graphic visual style that suits the simplistic material and he keeps you watching even as the wet, sucking sounds of skewered flesh grows tedious.",1
10123, An absorbing crime tale that works whether you know the twists or not.,1
53393, A film that succeeds due to the creative formula behind cameras that worked perfectly with the first film and for being hilarious enough that it fulfills its own pretensions. [Full review in Spanish],1
44604," In director David Slade's hands, the story plays like two movies in one, neither being particularly well made, whether it's the would-be action horror of a brewing vampire-on-werewolf fight or the endlessly talky Bella-Edward torpor.",0
20252," To the degree that Baby Doll and her pals are forced into becoming fetish objects, Sucker Punch contains its own critique -- though Joss Whedon's fascinating TV series Dollhouse explored similar themes with far more wit and skill.",0
77428, Despite its sincerity -- and the beautiful visuals -- the often-disjointed story takes too long to gain traction.,0
31198," It's too bad that I can barely remember the movie after only a week. Nothing lasts, indeed.",0
79443," ""Hell or High Water"" is dynamic, well-paced, and builds momentum up until the final showdown where it then turns the intensity all the way up. ",1
31609," The amiable Jennifer Garner spreading her wings as an avenging angel has a lot less to work with in terms of nuance and character, though the film far exceeds ""Taken"" in brutality and head count.",0
16314," An interview with Khodorkovsky, vox pops with ordinary Russians and some weird animation fail to secure contributions of great significance, let alone clarify basic issues of guilt or innocence.",0
63883," The question that has to be asked is, if so much had to be made up for this film to exist, why make it in the first place? ",0
73787, Nolan's sense of memory and of history is as flattened-out and untroubled as his sense of psychology and of character.,0
75829, A brain-twister to be sure. But the fact that the plot demands attention only adds to the exhilaration. This is a story about dreams that requires the audience to stay awake.,1
43198," The founder is, at first glance, a conventional biopic but it's the story of a cynical predator, the perverter of the innocent dream of two naive brothers who tried to counter the chaotic drift of those dinners. [Full review in Spanish]",1
57860," Part dreamy coming-of-age story, part crime thriller, part homage to Badlands, Mean Dreams manages to build a mood all its own.",1

81500," My, The Artist is delightful, ingenious, funny, poignant and, in its own small way, profound. Put Oscar on high alert.",1
23219," The most persuasive advice in the film is unintentional. If you want to know how to be single, just act like these folks, and nobody will want to be around you.",0
51820," Overall, a little bit slower and unspectacular than contemporary family films, but a little more memorable.",1
69895," A film that involves us in a story that must be seen and commented on. Like this one, there are thousands of them and, although in this case the vigor and stoicism of its central figure make it a very pleasant experience. [Full review in Spanish]",1
26268, You get the uneasy feeling that they're making it up as they go along.,1
28246," The ineffective quality of the music composition rubs off onto the script, a dragging narrative occasionally punctuated with workable humor. ",0
46962, Its choppy narrative and flashy MTV-style direction/editing can only be seen as a second rate Batman.,0
21579, Firewall is steadfast in its determination to keep its hero one-dimensional.,0
5473," A movie this thematically scattered, this unapologetically artificial, shouldn't be so enjoyable; but through the magical touch of cinematic alchemist Fran√ßois Ozon, this warm and weird tribute to the labor & women's movements of the 70s works.",1
58836," Comes off like a prank more than a coherent take on 21st century Hollywood, even if there are crumbs of truth and wit scattered throughout it.",0
27067," The film is just wonderfully ... well, Fellini-esque.",1
34176," Audrey learns that she must tolerate dishonesty of a devastating sort, because in this universe, Daniel's insanity prevails. ",0
52051," Fantastically smug, empty picture, which comes complete with a nasty-tasting dab of misogyny.",0
12825," Shouldn't a magical destination be, well, magical? Instead of leaving our jaws agape in wonder, Tomorrowland's architecture looks like a cross between Disney's Epcot Center and a high-end shopping mall.",1
45551," Practical jokes, general buffoonery and sexual misadventures abound, and a sentimental ""who's your daddy"" subplot involving Carl barely registers amidst the guffaws. War? Recession? Unemployment? Forget all that in this buoyant flick.",1
29929," As with Underworld: Evolution's 2003 predecessor, you leave the theatre feeling as if the filmmakers are still back there, with PowerPoint flow charts, explaining the flashback-intensive plotline ...",0
63836," A surprisingly amusing, bright, feather-light romantic comedy.",1
53392, My God! What happened to Sydney Pollack?,0
63207," This is a fond, frequently very funny homage to an act that has lost none of its genius. A new generation of fans awaits.",1
54707," What hasn't advanced is the plotting, which was nothing special last time and is so formulaic now that it's basically surprise-free.",0
1118, ... I can barely remember anything about it except that I'm annoyed that I wasted my time.,1
69707," If memorable war movies mean something to you, open that book to a new page and add ""Fury"" to the list. It belongs there.",1
31844," The ending of ""Closed Curtain"" has a disappointing lack of focus. Still, the initial mood of the film is indelible.",1
20959, Ambitious Paul Schrader drama ultimately loses its way.,0
25967," Tears waffles so much between three 'war-is' mentalities - hell, redemptive and super-cool for explosions - that it's hard to truly connect.",0
68335," While there are some powerful emotional moments, the sense of despair is enervating.",1
78329," Writer-director Bill Clark doesn't flinch from depicting the physical effects of Tom's illness, and neither does he pull any punches when it comes to showing us its gruelling emotional costs.",1
80367, This is undoubtedly the weirdest Dragon Ball Z story I've ever seen and that's really saying something.,1
52366," It won't convert the unconvinced, but it is beautiful, melancholic, audacious and well-played, a refinement rather than reinvention of a singular filmmaker.",1
46637," Bateman has a natural flair for comedy but it's McAdams who's a pleasant surprise here, a partner who's equally engaging and doesn't settle for playing second fiddle. Together, their on-screen chemistry is a huge bonus.",1

8230, The potent and provocative journey in Chronicle never stops springing surprises. You'll be hooked.,1
27389," It?s not a particularly great film, but by recognizing its own limits, Secretariat never tries to be more than a feel-good movie, and it's better because of it.",1
77840," Stunning, timely look at the killing of an unarmed man",1
2376," Jumper had potential, though. It's got a clever premise. And at its best, in the beginning, it almost feels like the pilot for a prime-time series you'd like to see more of. But now we're jumping ahead of ourselves.",0
22944," A pace and a premise that defies gravity, sending some of the laughs over some heads.",0

81626, Old fashioned storytelling that's moving and exciting.,1

38132, This film is so scattershot that it's more exhausting than endearing.,0
37105," With a light touch and a knowing regard, O'Conor manages to avoid the genre's most egregious cliches and simplistic life lessons, instead focusing on the sisters' often amusing rivalry and their ultimately unshakable familial bond.",1

17026, Allows us to hope that Nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker.,1
51085," That a movie this fleet and lean succumbs to action-blockbuster bloat in the home stretch is both disappointing and predictable, although the director deserves credit for keeping the climactic shootouts slick and spatially coherent.",1
14726," A weak, uneasy pastiche of styles and genres in search of a consistent tone.",0
32536, A relentlessly-hilarious cross of Kick-Ass (2013) and Watchmen (2009) that leaves your appetite whetted for a sequel.,1
55193," Lacking even a hint of humor or a watchable story, Disguise has distinguished itself as the summer's worst movie.",0
14545," It's still a fascinating journey, and the directors save some of the most shocking details until the end. At which point you'll realize that when you thought you were drinking deeply of the tale, it turns out what you had so far was merely a taste.",1
57876," The special effects and CGI, uneven in Sorcerer's Stone, are all spit-shine and shoe-polish in Chamber of Secrets. There isn't one hair out of place.",1

1090, It feels a lot like a Hallmark Channel movie that just so happened to land a couple of cinema legends in leading roles.,0

2542, Abandon ship if you prefer psychological thrills to cheap-shot scares.,0
70505," Certainly scary and nerve-wracking, but it's also ham-fisted and monotonous; to call Fresnadillo et al. powerful filmmakers would be like calling the movie's ""infected"" cannibals gourmet diners.",1

70148," Like Terence Davies's work, this is less about storytelling than immersing viewers in the minute details of an era -- what one of the film's characters describes as ""the poetry of confinement.""",1
78342, The movie turned my stomach.,0
6000," Ruizpalacios is too busy indulging in stylistic flourishes for us to form much of an emotional bond with the characters, leading to a closing shot that would have been really powerful if he'd tightened the film's structure.",0
60402, Fascinating and horrifying.,1
71292, Seems more intent on getting the musical numbers right than telling the story.,0
2686, Wheatley follows up his terrific debut Down Terrace with another genre-bending film that continually catches us off guard. This time we're watching a freak-out horror movie wrapped in a thoughtful exploration of the tides of relationships.,1
62889," Even while recognizing how much this French tale has been Hollywooded up, I couldn't help being engrossed by the story. ",1
23715," It's apparent that Rohmer is once again drawn to the orderliness of the logic and interpretation that his characters give to love, and here he is evidently deeply satisfied by the justice of the conclusion that results.",1
2212," Don's is a journey more bittersweet than riotously funny. But then, Murray is becoming a relentless minimalist.",1
14168, No one's a cliche; no one speaks dialogue the viewer could have muttered a beat or two ahead of the movie; no one hews to a mode of behavior fabricated to explain away his or her irrational behavior.,1
80005," Though Bird Box is not a religious film per se, Malorie leads by faith and not by sight. This film prompts a deep conversation exploring the meaning of interior, spiritual, and physical freedom. ",1
53225," Great performances, but the overall movie follows many known roads. [Full review in Spanish]",0
54190," Time passes with a sense that nothing is really happening, until suddenly too much happens all at once.",0
67998, Even the most indiscriminating moviegoer will see straight through the preposterous twists and lamebrain logic needed to propel a story about a woman who wakes up every morning with her memory erased. ,0

28045, Office Space comes up short in the final reel.,0
44613," Viewers will be horrified, either by Cheney's actions or by the film's portrait of him, but either way, the overall effect is more like watching a dramatized Op-Ed than anything visceral. ",1
72130, [The characters] feign passion as though robots programmed to complete impossible tasks. The whole is mechanical in this way throughout.,0
67746, Watching these superheroes save the day will only slow down yours. Stay home and do a Marvel marathon instead.,0
48018, Young Colombian director Guerra's visionary and wildly ambitious film seems like a movie from another era. ,1
18545, Viewers can't help be awestruck by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's unwillingness to retreat from almost certain defeat.,1

71220," The closer the character gets to actually firing up his rocket, the less fun the film becomes. The Polish brothers lose their goofy sense of humor, and The Astronaut Farmer turns serious and, heaven help us, inspiring.",0

32087," Everyone is a saint in Brown's eyes, and few are especially interesting as a result.",0

27071," A fascinating look at gay porn icon Peter Berlin, a blond god of the seventies whose crotch became an international cause worshipped by the likes of Andy Warhol. . . . a rousing, arousing work.",1
37801, Lader's clever screenplay questions what people truly want and expect from their partners.,1
76701," A lot has changed since 2001, but Super Troopers 2 hasn't. It's still as obtusely disinterested in broadening any horizons, and seems bogged down by a mind-set that is painfully regressive and immune to maturity. ",0
30155, Transamerica: What's your daddy's bra size?,1
62378," A super-slick thriller that doesn't let up, with exceptional performances all round. Make sure you catch it before the inevitable US remake rears its head.",1
186," It's an exciting and sometimes, for younger kids, scary adventure.",1
25129," Music and a deep love it is the jumping off point for this documentary directed by Peter Michael Dowd (The Beautiful Life). Mr. Jimmy is about Akio Sakurai and his love for Led Zeppelin's guitarist, Jimmy Page. ",1

1278," A mixed bag, Death at a Funeral has moments of real wit -- and moments when you envy the corpse.",0
45767," One of those movies that milks its stars' inherent charisma for as long as it can, but it does so mainly because it has little else.",0
53809, It's honest portrait turns boring and repetitive beyond limits. [Full review in Spanish],0
82084, Writer and director Celine Sciamma adorns the thorny dilemma with resonant allusions to gender roles...,1

59374," As both the casting and the eventual filming get crazy, Innocence turns into something like a screwball farce, an intimate, self-aware one. The seams of reality are pulled to the breaking point until the terms ""actor"" and ""director"" are purely ironic. ",1
44851, How many times do they need to reassert the message that family comes first and friends are forever?,0
21967," Surprisingly effective, even though its ape characters are a lot more interesting than the human ones.",1
74313," Underwhelmingly written and overwhelmingly produced, Battleship is a silly, formualic picture dominated by action set-pieces and CGI effects.",0
25175," A portrayal of family life, and a sly dig at both the filmmaking process and consumerism, this is a low key and utterly delightful little gem",1
9140," David Ayer doesn't stray far from his wheelhouse, even with the fantasy aspects. Bright can be genuinely summed up as End of Watch with magical creatures. That's not a negative.",1
64590," I confess: I had to steel myself as if I were preparing for a punch in the face to keep from bawling like a baby during 'Toy Story 3' (which, among many other things, is a very witty spoof of the classic Hollywood prison movie).",1
11348," The film fairly bursts with charm, the Gershwin songs are lively, Paris is as photogenic as ever and the existentialists are grubby to the life.",1
21428," A marvelous achievement, and one that fixes the mistakes Bryan Singer made...",1
25693," [It] has some funny lines from Plaza while occasionally inserting Grumpy Cat into ridiculous situations, but is mostly trying to do what it can within the limitations of its budget, its network and its leading feline. ",0

80832," The cast is really good, the story is interesting but it was kind of a let down at the end.",0
41625," Filmmaker J.A. Bayona keeps things visually interesting at all times in A Monster Calls. On a storytelling level, he doesn't pull his punches.",1
4663, Gorris has fashioned a rare and wonderful world capable of provoking both laughter and tears -- sometimes at the same time.,1
72741," ""The Campaign"" works best when director Jay Roach does the thing that he does best - slapstick shock humor and visual gags.",1
82661, Channing and Stiles are the right choices for these roles. They zero in on each other like heat-seeking missiles.,1
5365," an improvement over the first Avengers; everything feels smoother, the pacing is a bit better, and the overall plot is more intriguing",1
43862," David Tennant [plays the role] with conviction and a nice Glaswegian drawl, but the film is a dodgy business that makes things up -- including a pregnant girlfriend (Elisabeth Moss) -- for no good reason.",0
19543, Perhaps you would find more success at a direct-to-video institution. We wish you all the best in your future endeavors.,0
30165," Even with one story line and time frame too many, the movie conjures a mean Faustian bargain and leaves a classic dramatic question hanging in its air: What would you do if faced with similar circumstances?",1
23680, The Horrible Bosses comedy franchise is like a recipe full of ingredients that you'd think would go well together. But the taste ends up being off anyway.,0
60960," A graceful, contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined.",1
72008," This is an intense movie, with taut, expertly depicted tank battles and a believable sense of camaraderie among the characters.",1
8999," Slapdash filmmaking and a thick, indolent haze of self-satisfaction most characterize Grown Ups. It's air-quote comedy, with all the make-a-buck calculation of a rock 'n' roll reunion tour.",0
54599," By the end, I wanted to do cruel and vicious things to the screenplay.",0
82271," Armisen is deft with impressions and characters, but as a standup he still needs practice.",0
40808," There are vague hints that the story is ""really"" about the difficulties and anxiety of commitment, but then one of many variations on a fart joke distracts from any actual idea.",0
49311," ... pulls together familiar elements in a fresh and compelling way, using flawed subjects who are nevertheless charming and sympathetic as they find an outlet on their skateboards.",1
76795, The winning nature of the performances outweighs Takita's more obvious choices.,1
21069, I can't see a kid today watching this movie and enjoying it.,0
41683," It invites us - as in, anyone who's ever felt stranded - to consider our little spot in the world. Lavish with stunning imagery, the experience will ripple into your dreams.",1
15276," Despite the enormity of its scale and the detail of its creature effects, Kong's story lacks imagination and sags at its midpoint.",0
9239," Perceptive and humorous, this gentle drama is uplifting and resonant.",1
12214," If you're 12 or younger, you'll think it's hilarious. If you don't? It's going to be a long 95 minutes.",0
68951," The characters are flat and indistinct, and the actors lack the ability to give impact to the supposedly shocking revelations about their relationships, let alone do justice to the big ideas at the film's core.",0
10894, It's tempting then to call this U.S.-British-produced endeavor an odd duck. Except that Valiant uses nearly every pun in the book.,0
76878, Co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris have pulled off the essential ingredient for this kind of film: a cast that believably creates a family.,1
28956," There are worse movies out there than The Terminal, but few that feel quite so... unnecessary.",0
10658, It's like a sprawling mega-budget CGI movie about other sprawling mega-budget CGI movies.,0
5134," A monolithic sporting saga that seems content to pose on the podium, lulled by the belief that its subject matter provides inspiration enough.",0
34705," Gamble on the movie, by all means: it has its low-key pleasures. But perhaps safer to fold, and hope Hanson deals us an ace again soon.",0
13865," Pretty much a carbon copy of the first film. Full of cheap scares, and goofy connections to part 1 in a misguided effort to build a ""mythology"" so this cash cow can keep churning out milk.",0
81838, The film's strangeness will stay with you and push you to keep on interrogating it.,1
5579," Compulsively escapist, though it sacrifices its potential as a cautionary morality tale in the process.",1

30092," Andy Garcia, Oscar Isaac, and Genesis Rodriguez bring some depth and dignity to a script that is sincere but clunky. ",1
26638," It's certainly a moving film, and many will find its close examination of a father-son relationship particularly cathartic and reflective.",1
75502," Like the bomb that's lobbed in the boot of the soft-top car in its opening scene, Touch Of Evil is a film where we can hear the faint sound of ticking in our heads, but don't realise what the problem is before it's far too late.",1
16955," [A] haunting, richly contextualized documentary portrait...",1
31121," When I heard that Verbinski's latest project was a return to the horror genre, I was totally on board. And then I saw it.",0
82439," Clouds of Sils Maria invites those willing to wander through the minutiae of the obsessive celebrity artist, and that may well be a barrier to entry for those who might land outside that classification.",1
45214," No-nonsense quest movie is chock-full of bloody slice-and-dice action, suitably grotesque villains and life-and-death confrontations.",1
57642," Kidman and Law are chilly performers, and their fundamental remoteness drains the sublimated passion from Inman and Ada's hope-sustaining romance. It also allows the supporting cast to steal the movie out from under them.",1
59158," Despite its rich, picturesque scenery and a few briefly amusing and tender moments, Tulpan feels uneven, meandering, unimaginative and somewhat bland both as a drama and as a comedy.",0
79888," Repeat viewings won't make Under the Skin any clearer, but will cement its status as a cinematic game changer.",1
58291," Technically accomplished, narratively impoverished.",0
30014," It's a hodgepodge; a love story, a heist movie, social satire. Yet none of them work. The love story is creepy at times. The heist isn't that exciting and has very low stakes. And the social satire has no bite.",0
77461," This material, a modern take on World War II, doesn't mesh well with the old-fashioned elements of the movie, which include lovers kissing passionately while trains puff in the distance and the hero's trusty dog watches.",0

7520," Tries to make a virtue out of extreme silliness and disjointed, oh-so-random plot points, but the end result is a desperately tiresome viewing experience... At every moment, the film seems designed to be maximally annoying.",0
47263, [A] gloss of edgy noirish elegance cannot disguise the fact that this is yet one more tiresome example of the thriller subgenre that posits that the most interesting thing that a woman can be is out of her mind.,0
59797," The kind of lame, unimaginative comedy that constantly takes cheap shots at elderly characters, and then turns on a dime and begs you to see the humanity in them.",0
12143, A film with a story so crazy that you would say is real. [Full review in Spanish],1
69616," Verhoeven's strong suits have always been visual energy and a Rabelaisan realism: a gutsy, jovial way of ripping through social systems.",1
60586, Allegiant gives us a secondhand account of a similar tale watered down by artless interpretation.,0
501," ...a good title, good acting, good effects, plentiful bonus features, three mediocre stories, and a volleyball. And they say 2000 was a bad year for films! ",1
69695," The potential is there for a much bigger, better, Spider-Man movie universe to come, even if this movie doesn't fully realize that potential.",1
5137," The result is a story full of just as much intrigue, suspense, and heartache as in your typical spy yarn. The difference is: this all really happened.",1
77890," Ours not to reason why with ""Goldfinger""; ours but to gape and admire; which is very easy and enjoyable until the story's iceberg of extravagance finally appears in its true proportions.",1
32439, Overlong at nearly two hours but still a sharp and amusing and subtle piece of filmmaking.,1
59418," This is a taut, well-crafted film, with which even thought there's some gratuitous foreshadowing, keeps the views in suspense the entire time.",1
50942, A calorie-free snack masquerading as a substantial meal.,0
35091," She (Travers) may have made Disney and his crew's lives a living hell, but that doesn't make her a bad person --- or ""Saving Mr. Banks"" a bad film. ",1
69680," Not only made a satire on office life, but makes comments on white guys listening to gangster rap and inherent racism in the United States. For those who can relate to dying a little every day in a cubicle this is the film for you.",1
23192, A Christmas movie that would make old Bukowski's bloodshot eyes shine.,1

26217, Streep manages to transcend the material and outshine her other fellow cast members to such a degree that you wish they and the material were at least as good as she is.,1
6348, ...a killer thriller that has an over-the-top raw presence that stimulates and takes its observers on a tumultuous trip through its perverse playground,1
34664," Sometimes the writing gets too outrageous, as if O'Connor and Carnahan are trying too hard to top themselves. Look out for the scene with the baby and the iron, which is a nice time to run off to the bathroom.",1
80224," [Benicio Del Toro's] is the only character with human flaws, and in a movie perfect people tend to be boring.",0
14649, Step Up 3D is one D too many. This gimmick-laden film is filled with clich√©s in the production as well as the script.,0
26973," Horrible. No story, overt homoeroticism, and the death-knell for McConaughey. Is this the same director who did the fabulous HAYWIRE?",0
21783, A pretty good sports tale yet the human element is just barely there.,0

64948, A rarity for a Transformers outing: actual characters with definable arcs! What a concept!,1
23602," Though the whole cast shines in this house, the film is really a showcase for Dyrholm. Her stiff blank face, the stuff of an anchorwoman trained to take bad news, gradually wears down the soul behind it.",1

61352, It is an amazing story brought to life by gifted people and it will make you feel good without making you feel guilty for doing so.,1
35570," A flawed but thought-provoking high-concept satire that offers a new perspective of life as we know it - for better, bigger or smaller.",1
75368," The film works as a charming aesthetic exercise with its jerky camera and inadvertent cuts, as a contemplation on intergenerational female bonding.",1
23598," An engrossing, elegantly detailed, intermittently sappy dramatization of the heroism of Czech bomber pilots and the ignominious fate that awaited many of them in the years following the war.",1
36032," Even those unaware of Johnson's work are gifted an unusual break from the documentary norm, exposed to slices of life that reinforce the fragility and the oddity of the human experience.",1
29057, Shamelessly resorts to sitcom clich√© after sitcom clich√©...One has to feel sorry for the actresses as they go through the paces demanded of them.,0
17263," Over the course of its 118 minutes, the film delves into enough uncomfortable, tantalizing mix-and-match material that even Dr. Gonzo might have approved.",1
39968," This dramatic biography has the familiar Aaron Sorkin snap and crackle, but why doesn't it have any pop?",0
2528," Jean-Marc Vall√©e just deconstructed his oeuvre, his influences, and the A-list Hollywood prestige picture so that he could put it back together again as something even better.",1
6016, ..like watching some stranger's home videos of his kid...a cinematic indulgence which only its makers and participants could love.,0
48162," [The] script adheres to the usual genre formula of tomfoolery, in-jokes, mythology and outright poppycock, but their knack for teasing emotional resonance out of standard scenarios gives them the edge over predecessors and competitors alike.",1

36579, Just about important enough to be self-important.,1
13458, Earth isn't especially informative or original. But it is packed with beauty and wonder.,1
69587," Working from a script by Gary Whitta, the Hughes brothers, Albert and Allen, have made a stark affirmation of faith as a guiding light for a broken, lawless civilization, but to their credit, the film stops well short of proselytizing.",1
65349," Asides, glances, pauses, silences, double takes, and false starts-Hess catches an extraordinary range of wondrous humanity within the extravagant theatrics of his wildly self-presenting actors.",1
45998, Structurally too loose but the music in the soundtrack is awards-worthy.,1

60456," ... (for) people who want to cheer and thrill to absurdity and many random snake attacks, a good time should be had by all.",1
1983," At the forty minute mark though, what was a relatively tedious serial killer origin film changes into a rushed remake of the first film that ultimately feels like simply another grotesque sequel in the franchise's long line of bad entries.",0
28165," Johnson aspires to make Hyena into the stuff of classical tragedy, yet he telegraphs Michael's inward transformation way too soon.",0
39712," Drawing from a host of late-nineties influences but doing nothing with them, Terminal is little more than a shallow exercise in dated crime movie pastiche.",0

32336," You've never really seen a movie like Colossal. It's an alcoholism drama. It's a dark comedy. It's a kaiju movie. It's all of these things in one, and thanks to a tremendous balance of tone from Vigalondo, it succeeds far more than it fails.",1
35189," Hollywood's effort to say Something Really Important about AIDS turns out to be a timid, gutless joke.",0
62266," ""Ricki and the Flash"" is an uninspired story from an Oscar-winning screenwriter who used her influence to tell an inspired-by story about her no-name mother-in-law rather than a real unknown musician who deserved it.",0
69293," Brick would be better with a bit more Lynch in its soul, but Johnson is his own man, and I look forward to what he comes up with next.",1
68467," It's glum, muddy and muddled, a gory murder-mystery told bloodlessly, as in without any juice to the storytelling.",0
24695," Redgrave, like her character, is a dynamic presence when she's there and sorely missed when she's gone.",0
64403, A film so numbingly unamusing that you seriously question whether you were mistaken to have ever found Myers funny.,0

55285, An interesting effort to give one of the staples of mass entertainment something extra in the way of insight and feeling.,1
77020," All I really took from Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is proof - again - that all the money, on-screen talent and CGI wizardry in Hollywood doesn't add up to a hill of beans without a decent story to tell and a reason to exist.",0
75707, It had a great sense of humor about itself.,1
45058," The film feels stinting, as if there's more story somewhere that just hasn't been dished out.",0
44756," Engaging story about bright, inexperienced artists working through their tumultuous formative years.",1
9158," While the future of the DCEU still remains very much in doubt, at least most will agree that the first major female-led superhero movie in years is a rousing success.",1
50892, A beautiful movie that feels as honest as it should. Relationships had never been as powerful as they are portrayed here. [Full review in Spanish].,1
12603," This felt like watching the US blow the Ryder Cup. Everything that could go wrong did, anytime there was a chance to make a play it failed, and the participants looked like they really didn't give a shit. ",0
35917," The time is right for the return of Gordon Gekko, but making him a sidekick in a convoluted revenge plot, loaded with GFC history and allusions, stifles his totemic comeback. Less might well have been more, Mr Stone. ",0
62587," A more seasoned filmmaker could have given the it more depth and focus but I am glad I learned of this intriguing story of justice (or, injustice).",1
60834," On one hand, Robert Rodriguez drenches ""Sin City"" in his usual monsoon of ironic, macho macabre. On the other, do-gooder pride prove as dangerous as broads or bad guys, offering a thematically gray complement to arctic-white, inkblot-black visuals.",1
12393, A pop monster movie with lots of 80s influence. [Full review in Spanish],1
55848," ...the film's critical fans-seem to think he's breaking new ground. He's not, and the resulting film is more disappointing than the hype surrounding it lets on.",0
66858, A series of hit-and-miss non sequiturs in which his characters mostly humiliate and injure themselves and others.,0
13912," Not only is this the work of a major and vital talent in full bloom, it's the most thrillingly entertaining American movie so far this year.",1
69301," It's entertaining, it's quite moving in a few spots, but unlike the central character, it's not as exceptional as it could be.",1
19366," The performance of Mark Duplass, who could be called Mr. Mumblecore for specializing in low-budget indies, is the reason to see this.",1
52688, It reduced one of the great tragedies this country has endured into a viscerally exciting video game strung together with a love story so banal a TV soap opera would be hard pressed to touch it.,0
25237," It looks amazing, but the issues I kept going back to were in the structure...all the tension is diffused whenever we cut back to the past. Those sequences feel rote and familiar.",0
77839," Director Barry Levinson appears reinvigorated here, smartly building tension and a sense of ominous foreboding with the multimedia approach.",1
76332," Its take is about as original as its title, full of recycled ideas and half-hearted performances.",0
7751," Some would say that it's 'Schadenfreude,' a fascination with disaster, that keeps us watching...But this film provides rare insight into the failure of a American family...",1
27966, Bottle Shock takes a fascinating historic event... and renders it as a sidelight to an overindulged father-son conflict and story lines that start out well but never go anywhere.,0
57067," Like Grand Theft Auto's quasi-cinematic extension of noir and action-flick plots, Inception manipulates the digital audience's delectation for relentless subterfuge.",0
5551," Ultimately, we're not really interested in seeing whether there are any happy endings for any of these people.",0
19160," What is quite hard to believe is that you could care so little about every single one of the characters... On the upside, people can stop paying thousands of pounds on film school courses and just use this as a how-not-to guide.",0
3958," This inventive, delightful and visually rich fantasy is more faithful to Dahl's source material [than Wilder's version].",1

78758," Peter's story is entrancing, and Brody's performance absolutely convinces you of his emotional turmoil. ",1
8598," This is a film that probably shouldn't work, but does. Shall we dance? Sure, just don't slip on the sloppy tears or the butterlike popcorn topping. ",1
24013, Takes the well-traveled concert film to exhilarating new heights.,1
6270, Not even the two leads' star wattage can rescue a movie which plunders any number of styles and influences but never manages to nail any of them.,0
83112, Robert Rodriguez loves exploitation cinema but his homages to the disreputable genre are defined by italicized self-consciousness that leaves his humor without any room to breathe. ,0
57456," Hiding beneath the veneer of a slasher horror comedy beats a touching and heartbreaking dramedy about letting go, and accepting that sometimes nature has to take its course.",1
35176, What makes this truly appalling is that every so often the film actually tries to connect its ludicrous and action oriented storm scenes with the tragic destruction that has recently torn through the Midwest. ,0

31730," The three leads are pitch-perfect here, loose and low-key yet fully in character.",1

51006, This film is neither controversial nor interesting enough to warrant much attention either way.,0
30424," On this simple, sheeplike level, the thoroughly average When in Rome qualifies as almost a complete success, except in its requirement that we go along with some business involving hocus pocus.",1
2546," Conceptually, Lust, Caution has been thoroughly thought-through, down to every lipstick stain Wei leaves on her teacups.",1
41228, Saulnier clearly feels a good deal of kinship with the punks and gives them dynamic personalities that prove oddly compelling. ,1
759, The problem is that happy endings this strident and overextended begin to seem somewhat desperate.,0
7895," Hugely enjoyable, frequently funny British coming-of-age drama with a sharply written script, a nice sense of location, a superb supporting cast and a star-making turn from Jessica Brown Findlay.",1
525," Hellbent on being innocuous, high-spirited fun, but it just comes off as shrill and shallow and dimwitted.",0
26837, [A] devastating if flawed adaptation of the Richard Yates novel.,1
63572," Pogue repeatedly allows tension to dissipate, and only a handful of moments come close to inspiring actual fear. Otherwise, it's cheap jolts all the way.",0
26695, A textbook case of a by-the-numbers plot that just doesn't add up.,0
26744," An interesting, idiosyncratic piece that, thanks to an excellent edit, creates the impression that we are somehow following one single generation throughout the four decades represented.",1
29083," A sporadically brilliant escape that at times stops to preen and pose, like that he-man lout Gaston.",1
44654," Kill Bill's two-pack isn't of Godfather caliber ... [b]ut its scope, filmmaking ambition and uniquely twisted point of view make it worthy of being seen some day in a chronological home version.",1
40095," Land of the Dead is a perfectly adequate horror romp, but it's hard to imagine anyone remembering it five years from now.",0
69302, Jack O'Connell's performance and the fantastic work done by Jolie and her team make this a far more effective story than one might expect.,1

19892, Dogman is a wonderfully performed and beautifully composed piece of work.,1
69451," Youth Without Youth smacks of vanity project from the first poetic moments to the last, and whose vanity lays a stronger claim to the big screen than Francis Ford Coppola's?",1
37716," A very light comedy with a lot of swearing in it. Beyond that, they didn't add anything new to the concept of the series on which it is based. [Full review in Spanish]",0
16537," The main problem is that this version doesn't come from the heart, but rather from what can be gleaned and exploited. It's a classic example of too much and not enough. ",0
38089," While this by-the-numbers crowd-pleaser goes down fairly easy as any sugary, feel-good film is designed to do, there's also a hollow emptiness at its center, rendering it to be a well-intentioned, yet ultimately forgettable experience.",0
54864, The Trust is perfect for those wishing to see two fantastic actors paired in delightfully quirky roles.,1
55719," The frequent use of slapstick works a treat for smaller kids, and the assorted fruitcake characters work for everyone",1
53159," Epic, intimate, allegorical and ornery. ",1
8667," A surreal thriller needs a thrillmaker with a gift for the surreal, not the pedestrian talent (here) of Joe Wright.",0
29468, One of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while . . .,1

20109, A goldfish falls for a human boy in this imaginative kids' tale from visionary Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki.,1
35795," I left Glass feeling less annoyed by Shyamalan doing his thing than I may have in the past. It's actually a little fun to have him around again, demanding our awe.",1
65746," Sadly, it is the viewer who spots such truths early on, observing the rest of the film from a cold distance. ",0
54595," Exciting, romantic, and funny.",1
75975," The Meg tends to flit between genres, making for an unsteady ride between action, comedy and mild horror. It lacks the finesse and timing of a tight thriller.",0

62897, A nerve-shredding two hours even with awareness of how it's all destined to go down.,1
17449, Piglet's Big Movie complements (rather than detracts from) the much-loved originals.,1
17555, It is chock full of Nora Ephron's perfect writing.,1
51354," Fun, fascinating, but a fawning documentary that avoids asking the tough questions or making the harsh judgements. ",1
72077," In Jacques Rivette's remarkable The Duchess of Langeais, romantic devotion becomes a perverse kind of warfare, in which a lover who admits that he's in love loses the campaign.",1
41558, A chronicle of the spiritual retrieval of a lost man's soul through the work of psychoanalyst/anthropologist. ,1
65860," An intermittently convincing film about belief, rather than a film to believe in.",0

65328," Stephen Rea, Aidan Quinn, and Alan Bates play Desmond's legal eagles, and when joined by Brosnan, the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty Irish settings is a pleasant enough thing, 'tis.",1
60092, Not since Jacques Rivette's magnificent La Belle Noiseuse (1991) has a film zeroed in on creative process with the same obsessive care it devotes to the artist's volatile love life.,1
39073," Edmands' scenario provides plenty of opportunity for narrative twists and social commentary, but these aren't the areas of interest for the filmmaker. Rather, he's interested in the people ...",1
5069," For those unfamiliar with such films, Zatoichi might be a little off-putting. But given a chance, the movie can be pretty entertaining.",1
47527, Improbably compelling... it's every bit the rousing crowd-pleaser I wanted Rocky Balboa to be.,1
19863, ...another outstanding performance by Jake Gyllenhaal... his physical transformation and intensity reaffirm his position as one of our finest actors working today. ,1
48916, Littlerock wins your involvement by its meandering off-handedness and refusal to play up its strangers-in-a-strange-land conceit.,1
11803," It makes such gumdrops as ""The Devil Inside"" and ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" seem borderline competent by comparison-that is, if anyone watching it could stay awake long enough to make the comparisons.",0
54256, The film has the obnoxious tone of a boring home movie narrated by a guy shouting in your ear.,0
44453, ...meanders and stumbles before arriving exactly where we expected.,0
21454, I got very emotional during certain scenes because of Victor and Sparky's relationship. They have such a great relationship and dog lovers will definitely feel that connection the whole time. Burton's best movie since Big Fish.,1
33951," If your kid loves this, your kid needs to read a book, or even, heck, play a video game. At least you can tell video game characters apart.",0
59121," The personal becomes the political, and the historical, in this queasily imagined nightmare.",1
51766," There is a line of reasoning that dictates that any movie featuring Mads Mikkelsen with laser-gun-cannons attached to his hands should be at least a little fun. Netflix's Polar, directed by Jonas √Ökerlund, somehow defies the odds.",0
23288," Much like Baumbauch's filmography, it's frustratingly uneven. Razor sharp at times, but mostly scattered and unclear, out to comment on a generational divide without much of a game plan to guide the feature. ",0
68635," Aside from the political stuff, this is the same old same old that has been cluttering up stage and screen since at least the reign of King George II. It's not only not ""something new"" it's old hat.",0
6724," A strange and ultimately underwhelming way to say goodbye to a troubled, talented performer.",0
68610, ...it is difficult to not give a little respect to a film with zombie fish that stars a guy named Mungo McKay,0
71649," The visual and the aural are what make this film such a delight to watch, as Mr. Jarmusch is a metafilmmaker who delights in subverting film's narrative conventions and genre expectations.",1
67180," Despite the best efforts of an impressive cast, Taymor's adaptation ends up a curious mix of arse-achingly dull, and clangingly misjudged.",0
68728, It is actually called: April O'Neil featuring the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. ,0
36932," An animated tale that's a million miles from the irreverent brilliance of The Lego Movie, but mercifully still more than a bare-minimum cash grab.",0
56330," It completely fulfills its purpose: entertain you, even if it starts a little slow. [Full review in Spanish]",1
3647," It's loud. It's stunningly dumb. And it's really, really fun.",1
19313," This film is so edgy it hardly needs its monsters. (But don't worry, it gets them.)",1
43672," The film lacks creative exuberance, any side pockets of joy.",0
52844," An assured and empathetic feature debut, Lukas Dhont's Girl uses the discipline and rigour of ballet training to explore the journey of a transgender teenager and her relationship with her body.",1
44926," Perhaps there is only so much originality that can be mined from a premise that has been done every which way but loose, but how deeply can you laugh when you see the jokes coming a mile away?",0
50655," As comic adventures go this is amiable - almost entirely because the interplay between its two stars is engaging - but not sufficiently eventful to qualify as a thigh-slapping misadventure, or a journey to redemption.",1
68511, The bad news is that this is not the next Hunger Games. The good news is that it's no Divergent either. ,1
65710," The kindness and compassion the documentary displays for its subject, and which Fred Rogers in turn extended to generations of children, help make Won't You Be My Neighbor? one of the best of the year.",1
58373," I have rarely, if ever, seen a documentary reconstruction of a historical event that is so rich in firsthand (and well-preserved) photographic material.",1
66282," Paced with quiet deliberation, this is the rare horror movie where the mood gets darker as the filmmakers bring more light to the visuals.",1
82025, The best haunted-house-cum-ghost-movie I have seen in years.,1
69033," Younger is correct that considerations such as age, religion and circumstance can be enough to keep people from simply loving each other. And he's able to wring decent comedy from a sad reality.",1
4230, An insanely brilliant film that you'll want to revisit again and again.,1
23205, Wishing this film out of existence right now.,0
50888," This has the immediacy of a ""West Wing"" episode, and it's thrilling.",1
49447," Deftly moderating her patented eye-rolling poseur shtick, Page delivers her most charismatic and least divisive performance to date as Bliss Cavendar, aka Babe Ruthless.",1
79736," Harsh, funny, repellent and occasionally quite moving.",1
51404," With all the money this series has behind it, couldn't the studio have hired a director and writers who had the ability to set a little mood? Make at least something of an effort? Obviously, not.",0
44723, Martin Scorsese has been making good movies for so long that according to the law of averages he was overdue for a turkey.,0
43669," The period details aren't convincing in any of the film's eras, and the ambiguous finish is more harmful than hopeful to viewers looking for an ending to this sad bastard story.",0
26316," In an intriguing opening title sequence, the cameras pan about New York City's skyscrapers with frightening panache as if each edifice holds some hideous secret.",1
40447, Survivors of childhood sexual abuse will likely find The Tale a difficult watch. But it's damn near necessary viewing in this age of collective trauma unveiled.,1
31963, There's enough the film does well that it wouldn't be amiss on any horror enthusiast's shelf...the thin story is boosted by the competency of everyone involved. It's just that it falls into one of the frustrating categories of film: missed opportunity.,1
4086," Let Me In mimics the mood and mastery of Alfredson?s original almost to the point where it's a shot for shot remake. Yes, it?s good. But only because the original was good to begin with. ",1
62538," The cinematography and special effects are fantastic, but don't actually compensate for a weak storyline, and forgettable musical numbers.",0
29031," Aside from Jennifer Hudson's beefy performance, this black r&b musical never conveys much soul.",0
30292, Most off-putting is the puritanical streak that eventually comes to dominate the film.,0
23642, The amusing freshness of T2 is unsuccessfully recycled in this less superior carbon copy.,0
8844," There's a clinical detachment to [the film] ... evident in the soap-opera cinematography, the half-hearted plotting and the contempt with which [Cronenberg] treats his characters.",0
12959, A few scenes are giggly funny. Some are just stupid.,0
59143," If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best bits.",0
71702," Paul Blart delivers laughs, yes, but it's only one great slapstick actor and a little bit of heart away from being just another truly idiotic comedy.",0
54178, So-so Bourne beats most of what else is out there.,1
20327," Fans of the band will love the revealing footage, especially landmark moments such as bassist auditions (more famous names showed up than the one they picked) and encounters with the ex-Metallica members (Newsted and Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine).",1
29460," Fascinating in his portrayal of power, where the public and the private intermingle through the famous revolving doors and the payment of favors. [Full Review in Spanish]",1
32494," In trying to spell out what was going on his Pasolini's mind, he does his idol's talents a disservice. Ferrara tells us so much more about Pasolini -the filmmaker, the artist, the public figure- when he leaves it to us to imagine what the man thought.",1
62896," If you want to see a scary movie, go see The Ring.",0
52621, Directed by Frank Oz and written by Steve Martin...,1
77729," It never really adds up to much in the end, leaving this chapter of the ghost-loving series with and a mediocre conclusion.",0
53895," This is wrung-out neo-noir with no true blackness left intact, like a soggy heap of faded laundry.",0
61621, The Journey is the rare hopeful political film rooted in both reality and very recent history.,1
28010, Insipid potboiler set against the far more enticing surf and sand of Oahu's North Shore.,0
35468," Hide and Seek goes off the rails when the secret is brought into the light because it feels like a cheap gimmick, and not an original one at that...",0
27481," An inquiry into fundamental moral, philosophical, and religious issues, and an examination of humankind's capacity for violence - individual and institutional.",1
45121, This is the kind of not great/not terrible picture that will work better on a casual home viewing than as a big screen experience.,0
36529," Keri Russell is likable, but this feels like too conventional a rom-com for Sundance. ",0
64220, Less a sincerely kooky elegy to lost time than a slightly off-kilter acting out of familiar rom-com bona fides about commitment-phobes missing out on life.,0
26652, Just a series of Grand Guignol skits played for mean-spirited laughs.,0
13721, It isn't just eye candy; there's an active intelligence behind this design.,1
9666," If it seemed Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill couldn't possibly exceed their over-the-top buddy cop antics of 21 Jump Street, you lost that bet.",1
5954," ""Four Christmases,"" like its four screenwriters, are three too many. Considering what's been left on screen, it is downright horrifying to contemplate the trimmings.",0
5497, Naranjo offers a grim subject with neither flash nor sentiment. It is a sober film done with style.,1

20170," Alas, beneath the visual hanky-panky stretches a thin, hackneyed plot that was done to death in the SF magazines and third-rate films of the Fifties.",0
56423," The trials Ben and Sadie go through are nothing compared to the obstacle course inflicted on the audience, who has to work very hard to find anything entertaining or enjoyable.",0
40150, Steven Spielberg's dino-park thrill ride comes up eye-wateringly shiny in this rereleased version - even if its clunkier elements have become a bit more obvious with time.,1
76348," Insidious has no higher ambition than to scare the audience, and it succeeds much of the time.",1
17298," Barrymore is actually becoming quite the deft physical comedienne, unafraid to make herself look unsightly for effect. But her performance isn't enough to overcome even one of the other problems.",0

22314, Here's a Thanksgiving turkey that was rancid as soon as the idea was cooked up.,0
9150," While not a typical slasher film, it has more in common with 'Hellraiser' than 'Hellboy,' which should come as welcome news to those with a taste for exploding skulls, graphic decapitations and cannibalistic feasts.",0
82027," While the film might occasionally lack in subtlety, the vital takeaways speak volumes.",1

79744," Polanski shows us some surreally devastatrng visions and the film's ultimate ""message"" is one of unalloyed hope and faith in the power of humans to - finally, at last - behave humanely.",1
70125," In the goofball ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" Matt Damon repeatedly ignores instructions from God not to date Emily Blunt.",0
32105, A jumbled mix of on-the-nose comedy set pieces and contrived emotional threads that squander any potential within Sex Tape's entertaining premise.,0
14364, You've seen it all before. The only question is: Why haven't they?,0

20066," Willis is solid, as usual, but it's Parker (and, later in the proceedings, Hopkins) who seem to actually be having fun, which is mildly contagious.",0
27000," The writing is unfortunate, attempting clever repartee between the attractive stars, but just succeeding in making everyone slightly embarrassed.",0
75335, It's time to start the music. The Muppets have gotten a brilliant makeover. The holiday season just got a whole lot brighter.,1
46858, Avatar is revolutionary at least in this way: It is the most convincingly realized artificial world ever created from scratch for the screen. It's a movie to luxuriate in.,1

60227," Filled with audacious silly behavior, none of which has an edge to make its comedy sharp.",0
54009," A beguiling, deceptively simple slice-of-life drama, shot cin√©ma v√©rit√© style, Offside reaffirms Jafar Panahi's preeminence as one of the most humanistic and socially progressive filmmakers in contemporary Iranian cinema.",1
30234," Siegel's too busy making Paul the most pathetic person on earth to figure out what makes him tick, and he pauses from humiliating Paul only to portray Staten Island as some sort of cartoonish wasteland.",0
55185, Swank works hard but the Oscar-winner must wonder what she was doing in this hokum.,0
15243," The film may have its Hallmark moments and gloss over an unflattering fact or two, but in the end it triumphs as a portrait of a brave, brilliant man and the equally courageous woman who gave him everything. ",1
5953," I don't know if it was Canadian director Atom Egoyan's first decision or last decision to cast Christopher Plummer in the lead role in ""Remember,"" but it was unquestionably his best decision.",1
25922, A biting political satire that tackles rising anti-war sentiments around the globe.,1
29997, What delights is the movie's decidedly multigenerational stance.,1
3509," One might expect something more robust than ""Paris Can Wait"" ultimately brings to the table.",0
47215," The loving, thumb-printed claymation and an anarchic spirit mark this out as top-flight Aardman, over and above the comparative disappointments of Chicken Run and Flushed Away.",1
40908," An interesting way to talk about the different aspects of being in a relationship, including sexuality. [Full review in Spanish]",1
71734, An unsatisfying supernatural thriller with an effectively unsettling build-up and a frustratingly muddled pay-off.,0
69890," Johnson has delivered the goods: a film that isn't afraid to be ambitious, that delights and dazzles in equal measure, while providing a worthwhile emotional investment. It is a crowd-pleaser that will be wholeheartedly embraced by fans.",1
13938," You will be hard-pressed to remember anything about it even only a few minutes after watching it, which should come as a relief to everyone involved with its production.",0
22731," While Pixar's glory days may be behind it, their spirit lives on in the vibrant, emotional Coco.",1
83631, The film is an exasperating bore.,0
51317," A deeply silly movie that takes itself very, very seriously.",0
67379," It's an oddity, this film: a wry, wobbly cartoon made expressly for grown-ups, featuring quirky hand-drawn animation and very little dialogue outside the central voiceover.",1
41661," Make no mistake - Cars is still the best animated film this year. But with Pixar behind the wheel, the film should have cruised to must-see status. Instead, it stalls.",0
56845," By film's end, the notion of a rational and satisfying climax has hopelessly disappeared in a silly spiral of one-upmanship and a barrage of half-baked revelations that won't make you marvel so much as shrug and forget about them.",0
58358," It is an overwhelmingly dislikable film, an intensely unfunny and unscary horror-comedy about a serial killer played by Ryan Reynolds on his most irritating form.",0
31919," An uproarious yet deadpan satire concerning societal constructs, dating mores and power structures that also manages to be a surprisingly moving, gloriously weird love story. ",1
47290," ""The Lego Movie"" remains one of the most consistently humanizing franchises in the realm of family-friendly movies.",1
9883, Shawn Levy's cast often makes up for the routineness of the film's overused premise.,1
75436, A fine family film that affirms our spirit connection with all members of the animal kingdom.,1
78688," The movie is a tough, stylish, deliciously complex labyrinth of underworld double-crosses that, like most of the other Melville noirs, ultimately celebrates honor among thieves.",1
76890, ...almost a humorless parody of Roger Corman at his worst...,0
73127," Around nine tenths product placement, at least 15 tenths abysmal, and pulsates with molten cynicism on every imaginable level.",0
46444," A classic cautionary tale that works simultaneously as a thriller, love story, and meditation on what it means to be a scientist in a time in which everything is suddenly possible -- at least in theory.",1
4097, Rokah gradually exhumes the hardship of surviving the streets of Los Angeles for four decades and the associated stigma and shame that have prevented Haist from reaching out to family.,1
821," A must see for fans of Brie and Sudeikis, but there's not enough in the film to tell the majority to rush out immediately.",1
72407, The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is one of those movies that's much more entertaining to talk about than it is to actually experience.,0
18925," By the end, I was ready to buy a flag.",1
50431," If The Death Cure had been released when it was originally slated, it would have felt dated, contrived, and derivative. It still does, but a year later it's far enough behind the trend that you feel sorry for it.",0
39406," Wang...is aiming for quirkiness here, but he never gets beyond cloying.",0
66428, See it if any of this sounds appealing but don't say you attended unwarned.,0
27352, This might be the most pulpy biographical film ever.,1
73011," The filmmaking is as strong as the subject matter, with an elegant structure. And that's something that can't be said of every entry in this nonfiction boom.",1
16078," Three years ago, Matthew Vaughn's crazy, wild ""Kick-Ass"" was shocking. It's a quality that is not duplicated in the new ""Kick-Ass 2,"" which feels arbitrary and unnecessary.",0
61139, 'Elkayem's film is clearly targeted to capture young teens for no other reason than to rip off their ticket money',0
26766," The first of these movies remains one of the great sci-fi horror achievements of the modern cinema, but its sequel, ""Aliens,"" is that rare instance where a follow-up deviates from the formula and finds an effective rhythm in propelling the story",1
40697," Despite it being ballet-dancing, which I admit to despising personally, I still managed to remain quite interested.",1
69659," Alas, Haggis' commitment to bringing out the truth of the premise turns the ""The Next Three Days"" into a downbeat film.",0
80878," This feels bigger and more cinematic than the first film, and sees a progression in the lives of the characters. But many of the jokes are beyond broad, and the Middle Eastern stereotypes are shockingly cack-handed.",0
56932," The high-octane train sequences are staged with increasingly nail-biting tension, admirably shot without reverting to computer-generated trickery.",1
27263," But generally, Brooks' humor is extremely limited.",0
49627, The fascination of the film lies in its painstaking observation of the hapless lovers and of the world around them.,1
57243," My Cousin Rachel is an incessantly shifting story of ""Did she or didn't she?"" Literary types like to call this ambiguity, but director Roger Michell, who also wrote the screenplay, doesn't quite have a handle on that device.",0
12490," This major studio release asks the question, how long can you survive on past glories? Shame on Shyamalan.",0
71559, Robert De Niro is having sex with Carla Gugino. I know. It's like witnessing a traffic accident where an Edsel keeps slamming into a shiny red Corvette.,0
20433," The Proposal is a standard-order, by-the-book romantic comedy that offers nothing remotely fresh or new while following a formula even neophytes know by heart.",0
28705," It's not always the most seamless of hybrids and occasionally the joins show in the casting choices and the didactic expository dialogue, but the film is held together by a strong performance by Amandla Stenberg.",1
1668," In the entire running time there's exactly one scene that's funny and honest and not filled with heavy-handed sex jokes, celebrity cameos or fashion statements. ",0
1253," ... What it lacks in incisive satire, it makes up in big laughs.",1
2083, Provides a compassionate look at problems of old age that Hollywood rarely bothers to treat seriously.,1
83873," For anyone who remembers the ""Die Hard"" adventures at their vital and exciting best, this film feels like a near-death experience.",0
65773, Not just bad -- it is sad that it is so bad.,0
11168, By no means perfect but a solid effort at condensing a complicated origin story into a satisfying fast-paced action flick.,1
81726," ""Sully"" is the kind of film that may be described as old-fashioned and never goes out of style.",1
39098, A film that is beautiful to look at but lacks clear vision.,0
30696, The umpteenth iteration of this hackneyed story delivers absolutely nothing that hasn't been done better in made-for-telly thrillers.,0
39205," The main problem with Polina, the movie, is its script that begins following a line and is reconverted along with its protagonist in another... [Full review in Spanish] ",0
34350," ... assembles archival footage and interviews - though none with current Fox personalities - to effectively show how Ailes became so good at what he did, and how bad that is for everyone else.",1
30231," Although set in the early 70s, this feels all too of the now.",1
24364, The film could have been a winner if it had stuck to being either an emotional drama or a high-octane action entertainer. The mixing of the two ends up making many scenes looked forced and rather unnecessary.,0
26971," Bigelow tells the story very well, very efficiently, but doesn't really say much about it, which is ironic given the response to the film in some quarters.",1
42702," This is very unusual blockbuster - a Vietnam war flick, a comedy and an old-fashioned creature feature in one monstrously entertaining package. It's bananas but brilliant.",1
35962," Lacks the true grit of its predecessors, but still a worthy watch.",1
9626, Director Jesse Peretz commits the unpardonable sin of wasting the considerable comedic talent of Paul Rudd.,0
59910," A grueling, embarrassing vanity vehicle...",0
79910," The jokes cover the fact that the story essentially repeats the first movie's plot, even if it has to dumb Elle down to make it work.",0
6729," Even though Mars Needs Moms isn't female-friendly, mothers looking for quality time with 6- to 12-year-old boys could do worse than book group passage there soon.",1
47786," Exquisitely made...offers a distinctive, compelling take on the 'Scarface' formula.",1
72195," Bobby, seriously, what the hell is happening?",0
59347," A sincere rather than charming or laugh-out-loud movie-and tonally, one of the latter would have made it work much better. It's also too serious-one wants more outrageousness-because that's what the fun little premise promises but doesn't quite deliver.",0
3292," Sleeping With Other People has plenty of bad habits, but at its core is a refreshing and sometimes downright sad look at what love can do to people, dressed up with the sweet hope of new love.",1
49238," What Spider-Man: Homecoming lacks in depth, it more than makes up for with a pop sensibility that fizzes with verve and fun. ",1
14516," The Infiltrator just manages to stand out amongst modern films. Bolstered by a strong cast and an engaging, based on true events story, it is a surprisingly enjoyable experience.",1
80130," The student suicide rate is a dab on the high side in the tepid teen thriller, ""Innocence."" ",0
27049," What might have devolved into cutesy odd-couple territory instead moves in unexpected directions, bolstered by a fundamental idealism.",1
17283," By the film's end, truthfully, no greater insight has been extracted as to who this strangely anomalous superstar really was. ",0
39171," While the visuals may be rich and intimate, the story is a little preachy and characters very simplistic.",1
43049, A disappointment that underlines how great the original Harry Potter films were.,0
13802," An alluring piece of work, an artful whodunit that melds shrewd plotting with resourceful camera work and sympathetic characters that are fascinatingly, morbidly off.",1
27878," An attempt to trade on its predecessor's reputation without really grappling with the questions it raises, Monroe's version merely seems shallow, cynical and extremely ugly.",0
28049, a cinematic spectacle without equal,1
44664, It's also a fairly entertaining children's story. But for kids? Let's say it's a film for Wes Anderson.,1
63974," From start to finish, even when you're not sure what's going on or what's being said, you're pulled deep into its vortex of sultry intrigue and unhinged ferocity.",1
31167," Functioning like a metaphorical Freudian couch with intimations of Rupert Pupkin reveries, the film proceeds at a lively pace, soliciting surprisingly damaged soul standup introspective revelations. Along with peculiar interlude moments of found poetry. ",1
68303, Your appetite may be blunted by the surfeit of syrup.,0
36070," Most of the shorts suffer from similarly hackneyed story lines, with all action leading up to a pat resolution. ",0
72562, There is a clarity and urgency to Piscatella's documentary that lends it the feel of a political thriller.,1
5743," Adoration, which hinges on a number of coincidences, contains some really fine performances, including a surprising one from Canadian utility player Scott Speedman as the student's rough-hewn uncle and guardian.",1
34144, 'Greatest hits' show is tame enough for tween Gleeks.,1
48325, It is equally political and broadly universal and applicable in its aim of dramatising an unexpected trace of love that might be true and worth following.,1
59539, Sleepwalk With Me is a disposably sweet 'Annie Hall' rehash that achieves its minor ambitions with unremarkable efficiency.,0
31837," Pictures speak louder than words, and what 'The Illusionist' speaks loudest about is the notion that what we do for a living is not nearly as important as how we choose to do our living.",1
27593," In The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, director Julian Schnabel and his gifted lead, Mathieu Amalric, take us on an indelible tour through the highest and lowest points of the human experience.",1
54432, The result exhibits that the director is capable of a range few would credit him with.,1
74296," Dissonance between fantasy and reality aside, this poetic essay moves us because we know that its evocation... is very present in that acute pain from which humanity will never recover completely. [Full review in Spanish]",1
3615," Uneven, especially in the first half, but it gains momentum as it goes and ends on a rousing high.",1
49771, Monkey ends up being 86 minutes of action with none of the character depth that made Crouching Tiger an international sensation. You see it for its punch-outs the way you see Riverdance for its stomping.,1
57691," Supercharged by zesty, pin-sharp dialogue by writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, The Favourite is a brilliantly barbed character piece as well as a portrait of a historical period both methodically detailed yet ingeniously twisted.",1
56016, The most impressively flavorless movie in many a long age.,0
48800," As always the banter between Roman (Gibson) and Tej Parker (Ludacris) provides the funny, Hobbs gets an excuse to painfully body-slam several people to the floor, and Letty comes up with a clever bit of mechanical know-how to save the day.",1
73490," Dougherty harks back to the 80s and early 90s with gleeful abandon, lovingly paying homage to Joe Dante, Steven Spielberg and John Hughes along the way and it's a whole heap of bloody fun.",1
9783, If only the filmmakers decided to be more ambitious and plant a few things for older family members to enjoy . . . or work with a familiar narrative framework so part of the fun is watching the variation unfold.,0
1747," Just as Toy Story did by featuring an owner of the toys, it reminds us that these films are about play and imagination. Yes, they're also effectively feature-length adverts for Lego, but this is rampant capitalism at its most arch and entertaining.",1
35231," The result is an overproduced movie that tries so strenuously hard to be ""fun"" that it's a chore to sit through. For all its razzle-dazzle production values, the story itself feels cluttered, hard to follow and hard to care about",0
54769," There just isn't much happening here, other than some foreshadowing as subtle as a dump truck in a minefield.",0
14634," Just when Gilliam's art is on the point of imitating life and all life's incidental meaninglessness, it convulses into an image of stunning weirdness and clarity, and for a moment you can believe that movies really do hold the key to immortality.",1
34137, The plot of Smallfoot inherently challenges the wisdom of this philosophy and sides in favor of truth and the questioning of authority. It is a film that encourages young yetis everywhere to cast off their intellectual blinders.,1
14486," Coppola gives the events a bubbly potency, drawn to the attractive, greedy foolishness of the characters. They are, when it comes down to it, horrible, vapid people, yet the film doesn't view them purely as monsters, or as a sociological construct. ",1
70117, Luessenhop and his antic camera are after a kineticism that eludes them: He shoots too closely; he's practically crawling up his characters' nostrils with his unhinged camera. ,0
25487," 2001 compares with, but does not best, previous efforts at science fiction.",0
29417," ""Saturday Night Live"" deserves much better than the documentary equivalent of what a book editor would surely dismiss as a rushed, careless clip job.",1
33143," `Spirit' fans beware: This will work your kids up rather than put them to sleep, so stay away if you have an aversion to frantic fun.",1
81230," Lilting is not only a beautiful depiction of grief, love and hardship, but also a fantastic piece of representation for the LGBTQ+ community, as Richard and his partner's relationship is presented to us with nothing other than normalcy and tenderness.",1
62282," Shelton's comedy isn't just smart, but cheerfully wise; not just funny, but cleverly and endlessly so.",1
13945, This is Indian Folk Horror at its finest.,1
11540," Directed with respect and grace by John Curran (We Don't Live Here Anymore), Tracks' endless sandscapes and harsh outback make for a lovely, vaguely experimental character piece in the vein of Kelly Reichardt's Meek's Cutoff.",1
6211," Marks another successful barge into Hollywood's boys-only territory from director Paul Feig, who is proving to be the most significant director of women in Hollywood right now.",1
69555," Think of Simmons' verbal tirades as extended riffs, virtuoso variations on the theme of trial by ordeal.",1
57871," ""While We're Young"" is one step forward and two steps back for writer-director Noah Baumbach, whose movies are never less than intelligent but, at their worst, tend to settle for gestures instead of movements.",0
57441," Without Queen Latifah, Last Holiday would have been a somewhat tedious vacation, despite its beautiful setting.",0
80773, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as married assassins who try to kill each other in a genre hybrid that combines comedy and action to awkward effect.,0
36076," You can sense the movie's desire to break free of the demands of the rock biopic, but you can also sense it constantly being pulled back.",0
54369," Filled with low-budget action and low-budget eroticism, Michael Caine unfortunately does not make much of an impression as a rough-and-tumble gangster.",0
39972," FearDotCom was made with just enough craft to keep it from being the instantly dated camp howler its title promises, but it's quickly apparent that there's no thought or originality under its grim, familiar surface.",0
6096, An uneven arrangement of musical numbers surrounding a stage-to-screen adaptation that was a screen-to-stage adaptation in the first place.,1
44178, Swims upstream against high-definition with a defiantly lo-fi approach that's also ingeniously evocative of the historical period.,1
78804," The sharply written, potty-mouthed comedy isn't all-too dark, but the lightness is tinged with a sense of realistic edginess that makes the story feel whole and relatable. ",1
47872," Conventional but never sanctimonious, it balances out its familiar recovery angle with a healthy measure of sardonic wit.",1
72596, That you feel sympathy -- and a kinship -- to these searchers makes Huckabees something you'll gladly give your heart to.,1
16174," Coin Heist is like Ocean's 11 meets The Breakfast Club, but minus the charm, character and ambition.",0
28799, Chewbacca doesn't have enough dialogue.,0
36823," [What Richard Did is] the most conventional work [Lenny] Abrahamson has produced so far, yet still markedly different from comparable teen pics. ",1
75422," Earnestly acted, typically dour but dully formulaic crime drama.",0
81603," Never really loses that feeling that it's mostly made up of dressing around a harrowing circumstance. But I will admit once you're comfortable with it being what it is, it's effective.",1
57680, Daniel Stamm's The Last Exorcism is one of the most interesting and accomplished horror debuts of the last few years. ,1
60199, RFK assassination revisited as 'Crash' style roundelay.,0
8378, A Town Called Panic feels more like some exotic animated curiosity than a film to return to again and again.,0
46315," One of the year's smartest, boldest blockbusters, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 treats its audience with respect and assumes we have high expectations - and it more than delivers the goods.",1
31470," Won the Audience Award at Sundance last year, and it's easy to see why.",1
26587," Challenging, intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative. But it's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle.",1
36789, The film is strictly by-the-numbers slasher boilerplate. It won't endure past the weekend.,0
45821, It's both weird and wonderful.,1
3354," Despite being emotionally unrelenting and taut, and housing a fantastic performance from its lead, it still makes calculated mistakes that hobble its intent.",1
53399," Lavish colour-coded costumes, impeccable production design and nifty special effects make it eminently watchable, thanks in part to cinematographers Zhao Xiaoding and Stuart-Dryburg and the New Zealand-based Weta Workshop.",1
19384, A perky and chaste Y.A. update on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.,1
60246," Bold, exciting and full of visions.",1
31569," A mediocre follow-up to the mediocre original, with the production's speed to explore spin-off possibilities damaging the dramatic potential of The Amazing Spider-Man 2.",0
18544, By turns accomplished and clunky -- part of which is probably the result of its obviously tiny budget -- but it's never less than fascinating.,1
64387, ... intriguing mix of bloodletting and laughter.,1
36505," The Muse is sketch-comedy thin and features an overdone comic performance from Sharon Stone, making it Brooks' least satisfying film in quite a while.",0
15247," Though it effectively ended Mr. Powell's career, Peeping Tom is now considered a once-forbidden classic, an audacious act of self-cannibalization in which cinema itself is a lethal weapon.",1
69064," This is an interesting, frustrating man to focus on, all the way up to his muddled end. That Hawke's film will introduce a new audience to his music and soulful tenure feels like its own victory.",1
6578, The overall problem is that for an supposedly outrageous farce Sex Tape plays things extremely safe.,0
9489," Throughout, Hearts and Minds displays more than enough heart. It is mind that is missing. ",0
64197," With a crew like this, you can welcome the future.",1
17268," Messily structured, self-conscious and preposterous, buried within its own inelegant framing device.",0
53796," Without a doubt, ""The Exorcist"" is a touchstone in horror, seemingly incapable of taking a wrong step. Watching with the lights off is strongly encouraged. Turning them back on immediately afterwards will be a necessity.",1
45191," As an alternative for grown-ups looking to avoid the sequels and general noise of summer, The Nice Guys won't finish last. But it could have -- and should have -- been so much more.",1
82314, A thought-provoking examination of the media's effect on Boobus Americana. ,1
27178," A definite must-see. Loved the movie, the premise, the dialogue, the relationship of the two main characters. Love it all until it goes suicidal & implodes at the climax. ",1
277," A sentimental fairy tale of a film, Souvenir is perfectly pleasant but entirely forgettable.",0
46523," If you can willingly suspend your disbelief at its premise, you will find yourself moved at this love story for the ages",1
41087, Behind the smartass exchanges is a quick-stop incision into the heart of being young in North America. Clerks are us.,1
46470," It's a guilty pleasure, but it's definitely a pleasure.",1
68252," Yet if there's a real breakout performance here, it's Geraldine Viswanathan... She doesn't deliver her lines. She slices through them with the easy charm and rat-a-tat delivery of the OG Saturday Night Live crew.",1
56904," [...] While The Sacrament affirms West's talent and versatility, the film's basic conceit is a failure of taste, alluding so heavily to the 1978 Jonestown massacre that it feels like a ghoulish recreation of history.",0
20130, Dramatically anorexic.,0
57398, Jenkins does a great job with the material and Tom McCarthy's latest is quality work that deserves attention.,1
61303," A thriller typically is only as good as its villain, and too many of them are bloodless here. Except for the hot-blooded performance of Smith... the movie is cool, right down to its color scheme.",0
34957," Psychologically, there's perhaps something in the situation that's worth exploring, but director H√§ndl Klaus so attenuates the already thin plot material that after a while it's hard to care about these guys.",0
60679," It√¢(TM)s fine that this film feels uncomfortable indulging the shopworn tropes of coming-of-age story or black comedy or romance or mystery thriller, but, well, ambivalence is self-propagating.",0
13190," ... pay your money and take the ride,... laugh and ... be strangely moved by the odd-looking creatures Russell has assembled for his latest ensemble play.",1
18820," Is it a zombie coming to alert us it's time to start shopping for a Halloween costume? No, it's just our old friend Sylvester Stallone, sleepwalking his way through a stillborn crime drama that belongs in a morgue, not in a movie theater.",0
70391," Ben Wheatley's strangest movie yet: mysticism, mystification and magic mushrooms in a English Civil War setting. Often confusing, occasionally infuriating - but audaciously original.",1
34548," Who would think a fight over real estate would be so fascinating, so gut wrenching to watch?",1
34567," ...It's really nice to escape into the gleaming piece of chrome-ornamented optimism that is the Disney brand... but handcuffed by the happy ending edict, Tomorrowland hits a hollow note in its final frames as it beckons the big exit through gift shop.",1
78727, How a sweet story about a boy and his dog turns into a lame thriller about backwoods weapons dealing is anyone's guess.,0
69034," By helping Monsecour heal by sharing her story, Dhont has done a wonderful thing that speaks to his purposes and successes. I'll be interested to see whose story he tells next.",1
35438," What the Bielski brothers did in the forests of Belorussia deserves to be remembered and celebrated, but this glossy studio production robs them of life. It's not just new Holocaust stories that we need, but new ways of telling them.",0
32579," This movie tries to cash in on the current 80s nostalgia craze...there are ways to do the nostalgia thing and make it stylistic, but this one flew a bit too close to the sun and burned its wings.",0
78436," At times the writing gets so laughable that it reaches near Showgirls proportions, making it a performance train wreck that is full of campy goodness.",0
68155, Zahn is adorable and Jennifer Aniston brings an endearing tartness to Sue but even their best efforts don't redeem the muddle of Management.,0
15617," Though intelligently presented, it never reached my heart.",1
71747," The Mulleavy sisters have a talent for expressing the sensual and ""Woodshock"" never bores, yet it's never wholly satisfying either, its trippy logic too opaque.",0
37940," It leaves out the politics and lets us, the audience, get a vicarious thrill out transforming the worst day in someone's life into entertainment. Yes, American flags will flap in slow motion to a swelling musical score. ",1
47619," [Amma Asante's film] contains two praise-worthy performances, in the story of an interracial romance that had major repercussions during the era of European de-colonization in the second half of the 20th Century.",1
33333," The film is jolted into hopes and dreams and more importantly, escaping a blah life. But you can just sense there is something else. After all, this film isn't called 'Frank and April Move to Paris.'",1
41759," 4Ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as Pokemon videos, but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly.",0
22230, This is a defiantly British film. It's one we can be proud of - in moderation.,1
29981," Isn't it Romantic"" pokes fun at rom-coms while also recognizing what makes them so adored, and that perspective is largely what makes the movie work. ",1
934, ... a superior concept that incorporated all the key elements that made the attraction successful... a new franchise for Disney for sequels that won't have to be direct-to-video.,1
21632," Granted it would be nice to have a ladies' night out at the multiplex, but no one need be this desperate.",0
44924," Where Gosling goes wrong is in the priggish bombast. Instead of Refn and Lynch's self-contained worlds, he attempts Serious Commentary about the American Dream. But the actor shows no understanding of how poverty works.",0
23864, Adam Sandler and pals take a vacation from laughter in this dreadful coming-of-middle-age comedy.,0
60480, Pineapple Express is never really focused - that's not exactly the right word for a drug comedy. But Apatow and company certainly ensure it's a lot of fun.,1
24207," The palette is muted, like a faded photograph, and tense scenes are underplayed.",0
10955, [Oliver Stone] combin[es] skill and provocation with a passion to entertain in this riveting portrait of young American fugitive Edward Snowden.,1
36009, The film benefits from some uncanny performances that help it transcend all the dodgy wigs and telegraphed dialogue; and of course it has that majestic back catalogue to draw from whenever things start sagging.,1
9611," Molly's Game is slick, flashy, highly entertaining, and hugely forgettable.",1
11385," Hopelessly dumb and often unintentionally funny. As with everything about this nutty series, I couldn't shake the feeling that Stephenie Meyer's creation is just kooky in all the wrong ways. ",0
11732," Catharsis for both the prisoners and the outsiders isn't easy to achieve, yet worth the effort.",1

18301," The details of Kim's cinematic obsession are vividly spelled out by filmmakers Ross Adam and Robert Cannan, illustrated with clips of Shin's North Korean movies and ample footage of the familiar, coordinated mass displays of patriotism.",1
21020, Twi-Hards shall attend en masse. Adults shall roll their eyes. And on our human comedy shall go.,0
50533, This sort of movie was made for television viewing. You could tune in or out at any moment and really not miss anything. Or just have a drink beforehand and bring your rowdiest friends to the theater.,0
28440," Truthful, intelligent and likely to ignite many useful conversations.",1
59479," The spoofs in Marci X are so old and dated, it boggles the imagination to think of what group might still be offended them.",0

18367, 'Two hours of chocolate-coated pleasure.',1
29938," ""Creed II"" doesn't pack the same punch, either emotionally or in the ring, but as with seven ""Rocky"" movies before it, longtime fans will still be cheering by the end of this sequel.",1
24062," The Wailing succeeds at combining a mood of deep unease with visceral gore, buddy cop comedy, and a hallucinogenic mix of horror tropes - a recipe that yields, among other things, an atypical exorcism helmed by an intense Korean shaman.",1
82177," If you need a working definition for bad Jarmusch, look no further than The Limits of Control, which functions more as a wilful act of self-pleasuring than worthwhile experiment.",0
62215," If you are older than this target group, you will find it rather boring and stupid.",0
6340," This could have been, and should have been, a marvelous treat for children of all ages. ",0
54323, Looks and sounds very important but offers no greater insight into the human condition than the typical Transformers sequel.,0
56277, 'Tomorrowland' is a lovingly crafted beacon of cinematic hope that winds up being a little overwritten and a little too on the nose.,1
2286, The filmmaker simultaneously gives us everything and nothing... it's the combination of tight framing and the evident distance between the camera and its subjects that creates Victory Day's chief artistic attributes of intimacy and detachment.,1
49780," A thoughtful, detailed chronicle of the Fed's origins, responsibilities and shifting monetary policies.",1
35904," What it lacks, it makes up in great set designs and frightening tension; definitely a fun addition to the franchise!",1
40388," Lovingly photographed with plenty close ups of graffiti sprayed walls, gig posters and vinyl covers, Kelly's film also captures London imaginatively.",1
72406," The story is predictably pedestrian, the conflict laughable and the dialogue too lifeless to be laughable, but closer to that than convincing or compelling.",0
72417, The film stumbles to its conclusion - it never gives its audience enough credit.,0
80160, A story capable of subvert class and of race topics in a clever way with a deep and human portrait that annihilates various prejudices and archetypes along the way. [Full review in Spanish],1
69648, When this film works... it works! It does a skillful job capturing the mindset of a teenager coming to grips with his sexuality.,1
64682," While the romantic sweetness that it's peddling is a guilty pleasure, it's also a distraction from the gathering storm that the series had been charting so well.",0

708," Even if there's less chance the audience will burst out in fits of inappropriate chuckles, as was often the case in, say, ""The Happening"" or ""Lady in the Water,"" Shyamalan still can't quite pull off the delicate tonal balance he's after.",0

16547," It explores that roommates can be, you know, like a total drag sometimes.",0
51419," It's a mess, and I think perhaps Welles knew it would be... I can envision this as a future cult classic, but you may need the stamina of Huston's liver to get through it.",0
17155," Morris from America isn't shy about rolling around in genre tropes - it manages to be a fish-out-of-water story, a coming-of-age story and a slice-of-life all at once - but it rarely comes across as false or forced.",1
55179, It is extraordinary that a film this muted could resonate with a message this strong.,1
75478," Occasionally preachy and oversimplified, yet captivating, tender and heartfelt. It can lead to many interesting discussions if you open your mind and heart to it, and forgive its preachiness. Karen Abercrombie gives an emotionally radiant performance.",1
53345, My Sister's Keeper demands nothing less than a tidal wave of tears.,0
42449, Stephen King once suggested that we love horror movies because they help us keep our own monsters at bay. Let's hope so ... it's hard to imagine any other use for this film.,0
36690," Sombre and piercing, The Hunter courageously defends the right to voice resistance.",1
70691, Neither exhilarating nor entirely dismissible.,0
47685," ""Before I Disappear"" suffers from a bland, disinterested tone. In the end, few will care when all of these people disappear.",0

67979," Even for a Pixar production, this is a technically stunning piece of animation, and there's great use of landscape and water that often provides a stark contrast to the more cuddly central characters.",1
3840, The script creates a blend of timelines that engages viewers with equal fervour and challenges them to be evenly present in both stories. ,1
19429," Smug, artificial, ill-constructed and fatally overlong...it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite, degenerating into a pious, preachy soap opera.",0
30822," Whereas other directors have presented the man in mythic terms, ""The Better Angels"" renders young Abe relatable, provided auds are willing to put themselves on the film's wavelength.",1
4579, Lopez is badly miscast and apparently insane.,0

27416," ""Nanny McPhee"" with F-bombs.",0
76744," Director Ava DuVernay has given us Selma, a docudrama about a pivotal campaign in the fight for civil rights for black Americans. You could say this film writes history not so much with lightning as with compassion.",1
57592, Director Daniel Espinosa whips up some nail-biting sequences. But the suspense is all by-the-numbers.,0

55167," Relies more on ""gotcha"" moments than storytelling.",0
1470," The task at hand is to make a family action-adventure vehicle for some big screen names, one that bangs and clangs cheerfully until the end. The fact that it comes together with as much charm as it does is something of a mainstream moviegoing miracle.",1
51530," Gives us a Round Table and a flashing Excalibur but no magic, no mystery, no mythic resonance.",0
64963," A proficient but prosaic overview of Ginsburg's (exceptional) life and (world-improving) accomplishments. If you know enough to be impressed, you've probably heard at least a few of the oft-told statistics and anecdotes that burnish the RBG myth here.",1

70364, The Danish Girl is a beautiful film with brave performances - though Hooper often struggles to translate Lili Elbe's life into memorable movie drama.,1
71089, The film is put together too choppily to appreciate the bounce-off-walls athleticism of parkour.,0

3394, Its chief asset is Huppert: her naturalism makes every scene engaging.,1

53920," The What The Bleep Do We Know? crowd may well receive the film's wisdom like communion, but the rest of us are free to gag when Salva tries to jam it down our throats.",0

80309," The Cat's Meow may not be the remaking of Peter Bogdanovich professionally (after all, it's a specialized film with a relatively narrow target audience), but it certainly restakes his claim for artistic respectability.",1
23994," This screenplay has been around for a while and it's a shame it didn't remain on the slush pile, for the Coens and Clooney are better than this.",0
45245," Just call it 'Aliens for Dummies'--dark, murky, loud, gory and incredibly dull.",0
67453," A vanity project in which everyone looks bad, this wannabe sociopolitical-musical provocation comes off instead as hipster upchuck.",0
59240," Other than the oddity that is the main character and the inspired META aspect of the sequel, it really doesn't add anything to the premise that absolutely must be seen.",0
52694, Here we see the consolidation of a directing style that is bearing fruit. [Full Review in Spanish],1
26242, There is no excuse for a movie being quite this lame and stupid.,0
64380," Fun in spots, undeniably, but a mess on the whole.",0
14926, Plummer and Farmiga are great together. If only they'd been given material to suit their skills.,0
1477, ... a desultory mash-up of tones and styles. It doesn't really succeed as either melodrama or mystery. T√©chin√©'s pacing is off and potentially incriminating information is jack-hammered into place.,0
29585," [An] ironic, thoughtful film about war, freedom, and greed.",1
81757, Once in a while a movie breaks the mold and tries something new. The latest rom-com starring perennially funny girl Anna Faris does not break the mold.,0
63715, Absolutely breathtaking black-and-white neo-noir cinematography by Daniella Nowitz adds depth and emotional context. But it can't fully flesh out the story ...,0

62240, The slight pic benefits greatly from the talented ensemble cast that makes more of the tiresome dialogue than can be expected.,1
73827, Moving doc about troubled teens has powerful themes. ,1
83375, contrasting the original Ringu with the current Americanized adaptation is akin to comparing The Evil Dead with Evil Dead II,1

3253, The lethargically paced Babel alternates between being kind of boring to being mildly interesting,0
65362," In short, it's a mess -- an often lovely, atmospheric throwback with some clear personal flourishes, but a mess nonetheless.",0
48507, The film is most impressive as that rarest of creatures: a crowd-pleaser with a genuinely artistic touch.,1
3482," Nothing is said about Cheney's formative years, his parents - or how or where he acquired his amoral nature. It is as though he simply sprung out of the earth, fully grown.",0
69704," A rambling, unruly salute to the transformative power of the imagination that is filled with visual inventiveness, wilful eccentricity and even a burst or two of Pythonesque humour.",1
78478," Not a total misfire, but this first feature from Jason Zada fails to capitalize on its fine setup, its competent cast, and its exquisite location.",0
35197, The filmmakers' purpose is social portraiture with a psychodynamic context.,1
56923," You know, usually I expect the studios to dump all their cinematic turds in January but, man, it's March already and I'm still sitting through this stuff.",0

80394, Wiseman's are the movies to show to the aliens when they arrive.,1
19325," Tod Harrison Williams directs with a sense of humour that never takes cheap shots but isn't overtly reverential to the author, and the playful tone helps make the film entertaining as well as offbeat.",1
71411," Indonesian horror movie whose starting point is a pact with the devil, so it's never going to end well.",0
60043, The film also conveniently omits the fact that many other Arabs supported the Germans. That smoothing out of complex issues makes Indigenes more of a simple crowd pleaser than a genuinely challenging film.,0
13567," With the exception of some nice moments, mainly due to Kevin James' wholesome and lovable lead, Zookeeper is a flop and should be watched at your own peril. ",0
21303," Laurence R. Harvey turns in an excellent performance, but there is no escaping the knowledge of a rapidly hashed idea.",1

46692," Rent, for all its feel-good desperation and plague-battered bonhomie, arrives in theatres with the curious but unmistakable air of an artifact from another time, even another world.",0
28338," As a piece of filmmaking craft, it's competent, if unremarkable...if Love, Simon helps even one gay teen come to terms with their sexuality, in the friendly confines of familiar movie formulas, hey, it was probably worth it.",1
46605, Whatever wit could be mined from the idea of breaking the code to baby talk was exhausted in the original Baby Geniuses five years ago.,0

48970, Tasteless and unfunny: Sandler has still not duplicated the quality of his performance in 'The Wedding Singer.',0
50136, Such a haunting experience that it remains absorbing even when it doesn't go anywhere. ,1
64025," Queen Latifah and Common don't quite score a slam-dunk, but it's a likable, NBA-flavored film.",1
60344," Professional insight was exploited more profitably in his breakthrough feature, the biting Hippocrates: Diary of a French Doctor (2014), than in this sensitive, faintly smarmy romance.",0

33491," The film is generous to both sides of the moral question at its center, and with that one cannot but respond with enthusiasm. We need kindness like this in our lives.",1

19308, The film speeds ahead with almost gleeful disinterest in dealing with the narrative challenges it sets up before resolving them in the most perfunctory ways,0
862, It's like a Scarface homage and at times the aesthetics are similar to The Wolf of Wall Street but it's an entertaining movie. [Full review in Spanish],1

50618, Forgive this film its marvelous moodiness-someone needs to go there once in a while.,1
29174," The good kind of fall movie - intelligent, literate and entertaining, deserving of praise without ever nakedly angling for awards. Prizes would be nice, but the best result would be for the powers that be to give Holofcener more money to make more films.",1

35300, Adults without kids may find their minds wandering even with the brief run time and those 3-D visuals.,0
67750, The real problem with this movie isn't its trashy side. It's the creepy note of causal judgment that hangs over it concerning the potential nightmare of parental visitation and enforcer ex-wives.,0
24344," McConaughey has never really found his niche as a movie star, occasionally scoring in an adventure film, but lumbering through a series of romantic comedies to no good effect.",0
50332," Not one character has the emotional maturity of an English muffin. If we could harness the intellectual energy of everyone involved in this, we could toast one. Lightly. ",0
16435," It's hard to know what is more impressive, the artistry of The Interpreter or the sheer craft of it.",1

72780," It's exciting as a raw, provocative, and vividly realized cinema of sensation.",1
4984," In its determination to emphasize character and thoughtful content over formulas and facile sensationalism, it's a movie that's proudly out of step with Hollywood trends.",1

6279, The problems of A War are primarily ones of in the way [Tobias Lindholm] frames this situation.,0
20660," The film's makers get just how rich, even ecstatic, these subcultures of movement can be. It's aggravating then, to see how easily they trip up that vitality with uninspired storytelling.",0

36749," Though it comes with a heavy reliance on Cinderella for a plot, it's fun, silly, and busy. You will need a high tolerance for disco, though.",1
46432," Despite the fact that we've seen it all before, it works.",1
13969," Overboard got me to invest in its central pairing, and benefits from a Latin flavour that goes beyond Derbez, but the overall experience is ultimately pretty forgettable.",0
29242," ...Eddie the Eagle might not soar above the pantheon of underdog sports films, but works as a charming, inoffensive addition to the very long list of fun sports movies.",1

56785," Directing with a cool, steady hand that renounces shaky-cam the way Fletcher would denounce rock 'n roll, and getting strong performances from his two leads, Chazelle provides a potent metaphor for artistic ambition as both a religion and an addiction.",1
44010," Sing has the same kind of generic 'be yourself' message that so many children's movies do, but is supported by excellent vocal performances and a likeable soundtrack.",1
1886, A version of McEwan's tale so partial you wondered why they bothered. ,0
58254," Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Backed by a killer soundtrack, American Animals is an exhilarating and bloody good movie from start to finish.",1
51068, Overall it's a solid superhero movie with some memorable moments.,1
9722," An organic narrative that might feature improvised dialogue but never seems false, ""Person to Person"" carves out an easily listening vibe as the various stories unfold.",1
38065," Too bad it signifies nothing. Marie Antoinette is a languorously detailed period piece, partly filmed at the palace in Versailles, that is almost pornographically obsessed with fashion, jewelry and desserts.",0
9981," Edmond is a slight, self-consciously arty affair that starts off like a gloomy version of Falling Down before petering out with a deeply anti-climatic ending.",0
78744, This is a highly confused film that doesn't seem to know exactly what it wants to be.,0

69814," For those of us women who have been a little in love with Sam Elliott all these years, ""The Hero"" should be on your ""See It Now!"" list. ",1
79205, White Noise is little more than an old-fashioned ghost story with a newfangled twist.,0
29238," Sparse in dialogue and relentlessly bleak, The Witch will likely appeal to those who like their horror stripped back to basics, but boy does it pack a punch sometimes.",1
24876," There's much that's simplistically touching, optimistic, and appealing in the filial trend, just as there's much that's simplistically grand, worthy, and fine in Perdition.",1
58166," J.C. Chandor creates an austere snapshot of human struggle, ingenuity, and perseverance, one that's predicated on Robert Redford's fantastic performance.",1
77260," Overloaded with calculated stand-up-and-cheer moments, and there are far too many close-ups of Elle's cuddly Chihuahua.",0
44091," This Elaine May comedy was the most underappreciated commercial movie of 1987. It isn't quite as good as May's previous features, but it's still a very funny work by one of this country's greatest comic talents. ",1

74401, A remarkably straightforward and effective thriller.,1
33407," The movie is a less assured version of Shira Piven's Welcome to Me, in which she and Kristen Wiig unleash the full neurotic potential of the ""15 minutes of fame"" expression. The Clapper only pays lip service to it.",0

12829," Tarji is good. The idea of her character is good. The idea of this movie is good. But you can tell that there was someone in the writer's room that was like, ""Let's just go back to our usual tropes about these kind of movies."" ",1
79548," It's too cartoonish and cosy by half, a sort of Punch-and-Judy-show rendition of a fascinating man's professional crisis.",0
42047, Crikey! We've barely forgotten the recent Australian serial-killer drama Wolf Creek and now here we are again.,0
12488, The whole thing feels less like a genuine Woody Allen comedy than a pale imitation.,0
57162, At no point does this film strive to be more than a second-rate version of what it is: a halfhearted attempt to make some scratch while pretending the devil exists. Some trick.,0
11500, It's hard to see the fish for the froth in Lasse Hallstrom's twee adaptation of Paul Torday's novel. ,0
29569, Water For Elephants casts a spell with its arresting visuals and the cast looks ravishing through a soft-focus lens.,1
62819," Does everyone look ""over it"" because they're tired of fighting for the revolution-or because they really are? As Mockingjay flutters and flaps to a close, this victory lap looks and feels like a slog.",0

5065, The experience of viewing Death Wish can be described as awkward at best. ,0
20696," The Queen is the most reverent irreverent comedy imaginable. Or maybe it's the most irreverent reverent comedy. Either way, it's a small masterpiece.",1
51192," I know this thing's been kicking almost half a millennium, but is it too much to ask for a little invention?",0
30742, Shortbus director John Cameron Mitchell revives the cartoonish mania of that outing and applies it to what resembles a film-school project held together with papier-mache and zany indulgence.,0
81211," We all know Denzel Washington is among the best in the business. We expect excellence from him. But that doesn't make it any less enjoyable when he delivers, as he does here.",1
59681," The best moments in Coco are the less splendiferous, more solemn segments, especially the loving exchanges between Miguel and his great-grandmother Mama Coco, when the Pixar magic truly unfolds and our tear ducts get a good workout.",1
655," Layton's dazzling film is an exciting, edge-of-your-seat experience superior to any Hollywood mystery you're likely to see for a long time.",1
36383," In compressing Maynard's deeply internal book into the necessarily visual film format, Reitman strips the story of nearly all of the book's barely repressed sexual heat, and hence most of its impact.",0
1618," The film's images extricate beauty from the most dismal of situations and together with his actors, Hu manages to evoke emotions so deeply felt and overwhelming that they compensate for any narrative contrivances.",1
51075, Bottom line: Searching is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while.,1
77187," hankfully, with a cast like this one, you're treated to a vast array of characters to cling on to. Some of them feel more like action figures than characters, but it's a delight to have characters that are colourful - in more than one sense of the word.",1
1574," Testament of Youth is refreshingly old school in its approach, shunning frantic editing and acting histrionics to keep things strictly British and stiff upper lip.",1
75103," The greatest sin of ""Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame To Kill For"" is the way its high style is brought low -- visually stunning, but emotionally vapid, unrelentingly violent, its splendiferous comic book cast mostly squandered.",0
68311, We may have seen different versions of this coming of age story but there is something fresh and enticing about this one. Today and tomorrow - what a difference a day makes!,1
78227," Filled with magnificent performances from Tess Harper, Bonnie Hunt, Michael Learned and Chris Sarandon, the movie is weighty without being overwhelming",1
10574," On one level, it doesn't *seem* new and familiar, and yet here it is, feeling so anyway.",1
28033, An agreeable if unremarkable work of indigenous realism whose familiarity of form is ably offset by the singularity of its milieu.,1
1472," Their rapport never felt false to me, didn't come across like a convenient plot device allowing the director to take things from A to B, both Gaitan and Flores digging into their character's very souls.",1
25459," A bloated, half-baked movie.",0
43456," A scintillating, well told tale.",1
62384, The cinematic rebirth of Superman could not have been put in abler hands. Director Bryan Singer has taken us soaring back into the sky.,1
83138, ...an overlong running time and needlessly prolonged narrative.,0
42935," It's a traditional, handsome, for-your-consideration biopic in many ways, but it's also deeper than that, and Marsh includes little grace notes that don't conform to the standard formula.",1
77062," At the last minute, The Layover tries to become about female empowerment, but it would have to actually like women for that to work.",0
24010," Cut-rate CGI, shaky performances, and a frequently unintelligible screenplay sink the ship.",0
69459, All the performances are wonderful and frankly films are rarely this genuine and consistently entertaining.,1
55540," All the glossy, kinetic animation and inventive action sequences get lost in the gag machine. The film throws jokes out like a tennis-ball machine on the fritz: gross humor, slapstick pratfalls, bizarre non sequiturs.",0
7225," Flashes of freshness are utterly M.I.A. in Fantastic Four's final act, which is where its human drama is preempted by stagey, CGI-addled superhero posturing.",0
4065," Shoulda been big fun, but a deadly combination of no script and a strange lack of sexiness renders this male-stripper tale an aimless, although very commercially calculated, bore.",0
51979," The dialogue is stilted, full of clumsy exposition, clumsily staged; it veers unsteadily from banal to overly ""written,"" and her actors don't know what to do with it, so most lean broad.",0
24607, Technical elegance and fine performances mask the shallowness of a story as simpleminded as the '50s TV to which it condescends.,0

44520," T2 Trainspotting has one foot firmly planted in nostalgia and the other rooted in the present, and thanks in great part to Boyle's unique, world-class talent, everything old feels new again.",1
9083," Considering what a commanding majority of the film's running time is made up of large-scale action scenes and chases in CGI environments, it's disastrous that only one of them is any good.",0
66904," Evans has conducted a symphony of violence that is disgustingly brutal, awe inspiring and innovative in its choreography. No punch, kick, lunge or thrust of weapon is wasted...even the car chase has to be seen to be believed!",1
54236, It reduces the domestication of wolves to a series of simplistic interactions that don't exactly convey the difficulties of a wild animal overcoming millennia of instinct.,0
58797," Never have I seen such an intelligent, emotionally resonant screen adaptation of a comic book. Spider-Man 2 takes the genre to a whole new level.",1
61988," The pervasive and sometimes actually damaging problem is that the film has a non-diegetic musical score, and it really shouldn't.",1
55697, a difficult film to parse out and to appreciate.,0
45935," ""Before I Disappear"" would be a better movie if would-be triple-threat talent Shawn Christensen got out of his own way.",0
44418, [The] trite boy-meets-girl arc (he lies about his job) is occasionally offset by some potent comic misadventures.,0
1522," A film that, for every scene of genuine hilarity, all too often just lies there smirking at itself about how darn clever it is.",1
71501, [The film's] intellectualized sexuality stirs neither the head nor the nether regions.,0
66542," Less an investigation into or comprehensive summary of the Penn State sex-abuse scandal than a look at the feelings it elicited, Amir Bar-Lev's Happy Valley is more concerned with the phenomenon of team spirit than any single question of fact.",1
66281," The story offers no scares or surprises (other than things popping out suddenly from corners), but it checks off the boxes without actively insulting your intelligence. ",0
51378," If you're looking for an engaging movie with complex characters and an intense storyline, then look elsewhere.",0
50297," Cooper and Lady Gaga are dynamite together; this is a story that lives and dies by the central relationship and the instant chemistry that must blossom between them, and these two have it in spades.",1
29262," If you're expecting a sophisticated battle of the sexes comedy with smart, witty dialogue, you'll be disappointed, but there's genuine chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler, and in director Robert Luketic's hands, there's fun to be had",1

54930, A muddled teenpic.,0
63959," Rather than a strong script, Winterbottom relies on a hyperactive camera, as if he were trying to recreate an updated dramatic classic by way of a music video.",0
20761, [T]he bringing to life of Pandora and the Na'vi is a quantum leap forward in movie special effects. It seems so real you may be tempted to book a trip there yourself.,1
23008," The monsters show a definite affection for knives and razors and scissors, all the better to slash and penetrate their victims.",0
7409," The film, co-written by Vallelonga's son Nick, owes what artistic success it offers to two strong central performances.",1
11977," Bad accents and a bucket list of clich√©s, Departures never takes flight.",0
24112, A deliciously snarky tale of corruption and malfeasance most foul that could have only gone down in South Florida. Corben directs this juicy yarn like the smart aleck in class who can't seem to stay out of trouble.,1
71018, Pavan Moondi mines hilarious comedy from this tale of doofuses in oddball situations.,1
70733," Director Jaume Collet-Serra hard-sells the primal fear, building suspense with simple methods.",1
2273, Not very impressive from a storytelling aspect.,0
13757," In a weak year for mainstream cinema, Easy A stands out as one of the best of the bunch.",1
81140, This well-sung and perfectly acted adaptation falls way short of a triumph because Burton misplaces his sense of humor. He only almost makes Sweeney Todd his own.,0
69164," It's a smart and entertaining show, and it harks back to a time when politics and television were still feeling each other out, looking for an opening, a knockout punch.",1
42894, Another feeble 007 parody.,0
22177," Rich, creative Western with much to say about politics and gender.",1
59047," Saved primarily by a first act that stuns and a leading man that captivates, Goat needed to go further into its excoriating of this lifestyle to be more than a blip on the cinematic radar.",1
42952, A film with a great story and something for everyone. [Full review in Spanish],1
38446," Although some will predictably succumb to Gray's overly kinetic and slick-looking heist caper, this stylized action-packed robbers flick fails to steal anything worth value within this repetitive genre.",0
34586," Crude, daft and hilarious, Dodgeball is the best mainstream American comedy in years.",1
16264, A messed-up way to spend Mother's Day,1
21599," Has everything you could want in an American independent film. It's daring, sexy and redolent with regional atmosphere. All the actors work well above their heads. Many of you will probably hate it anyway.",0
2441," As a critic specializing in scary films, I can honestly say that in the last three years alone there's been several that have impressed me more... I don't get what makes It so special.",0
48023," The kind of movie that soars beyond adjectives like ""good"" or ""bad"": it's sincere but overstuffed, visually gorgeous but dramatically clunky, and it represents a singular vision while simultaneously featuring two wildly miscast actors in the lead roles.",1
62413, A movie for everyone in the family to treasure.,1
58296, I just found the movie kind of unpleasant.,0
10632," I may be an old curmudgeon, but one with a better outlook on life and people than the characters in Alex Ross Perry's latest film.",1
47121," Seriously, I think this is the first time I can remember seeing Phoenix smile on camera since ""Parenthood."" ",1
56483," It's short, at about 80 or so minutes, full of energetic music and bodybuilding/action montages and juvenile penis discussions, and against those odds it's still very, very dull. ",0
15083, Not only opens up a whole innovative universe of dark cinematic surprise but also exciting new territory for Potterphiles as the wizarding world moves from sedate rural England to the helter skelter jazz age of prohibition era New York.,1

61655," Woody Allen cranks out another formulaic interweave of romantic crushes, with old jazz on the soundtrack to supply some artificial gaiety.",0
65299," With mouthwatering visions of fresh fish wrapped in heavenly white rice, Jiro will not only tickle your taste buds. It will leave you with your own dreams of sushi.",1
60548," Ultimately, Baywatch can never make up its mind whether it wants to mock glitzy softcore action-fests or just be one.",0
15975," It's a pity, you can see the undeniable efforts from production and much talent gathered for an ambitious project... We expected more. [Full Review in Spanish] ",0
12364, Audacious even for a filmmaker as crass as Danny Boyle.,0
75631," ""Seasons"" paints a beautiful picture and then takes a somewhat obvious hammer to it, leaving its upbeat afterthought somewhat stranded.",1
5047, A presumably rectifiable dilemma for urbanites needs more serious treatment.,0
50178, The villains of Spectre self-servingly repeat the mantra that technology has evolved to the point where the world doesn't need 00 agents anymore. The ultimate irony of Spectre is that it inadvertently proves that the villains are right.,0
32367, A werewolf howler with no bite or bark. It's completely scream-free.,0
41381," What ensues, at least initially, has a straightforward and rather linear structure that smacks of period television, but the underlying story is such a good one that it soon gains real momentum.",1
20944," Hazanavicius has confused sobriety with impact, and mulched down all the stories you might want to tell about Chechnya into a generic, undermotivated wallow.",0
24492, A beautiful and electric documentary that captures so vividly both the rapture at the heart of the Tahrir Square protests of 2011 and the sense of betrayal that followed.,1
54049," Despite some clich√©d moments, it is enjoyable, and I would recommend it for the acting and the historical significance.",1
2873," For John Cusack lovers, ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" is one of his best, an engaging showcase for his droll demeanor and a seamless blend of comedy and action. It's light entertainment, in spite of the body count.",1
83141, Cake could have used more layers.,0
42761, Philip Seymour Hoffman brings the gravitas needed to add nuance to some conventional machinations. ,1
61633," [It] wouldn't work at all without the very talented Giamatti. He has to portray a person with a soul, as well as a soulless one, and make us believe that's the case. He does so, perfectly.",1
27827," The ""so bad it's good"" factor occasionally kicks in. But even with those ascents from base camp to high camp, this noisy, assaultive, stunt-oriented film leaves us clawing for the oxygen of human and dramatic interest.",0
78453," The film is terrific ... at capturing the drip-drip-drip of what amounts to, basically, Panahi's home imprisonment.",1
41710, This biopic serves as a good crash course on the explicit world of gangsta rap.,1
27148, Unfolds with precision and excellent pacing. It's been a long while since I've been so unnerved in a theater.,1
74790, It's all too familiar Bu√±uel and lacks the bite of some of his earlier and sharper edged films.,1
18538," The sort of movie that gives you a headache if you're old, but a vast amount of joy if you're a kid.",0
14982, The beautifully observed details of this heroine's journey are heartbreaking.,1
77032, Songs that tell their story from both their points of view are among the smartest show tunes this side of Stephen Sondheim.,1
79781, The fact that the movie was able to recycle the plot of Star Trek V will likely never get the level of praise it deserves. ,1
68266, A searing expose of the greed and systemic poor treatment of its workers by the largest corporation in the world.,1
27334," The language of contemporary hack filmmaking is universal, especially when it comes to the sight of women brutalized by a serial killer.",0
44070, It's wearying to watch Allen's murder obsession when he doesn't know how to dramatize morality.,0
42375, As bland and anonymous in practice as it is on paper.,0
18944," Fueled by a quietly morally outraged performance by Will Smith, this muckraking film can be conventional in its execution, but the story itself is plainly affecting.",1
15774," The word ""slow"" in the title is no lie, but the movie is far from boring.",1
35390," ""Mean Dreams"" begins with an interesting premise, infused with a few chilling scenes, but the showdown at the end of the film featuring Paxton is not as intense as the situation demands. ",1
53725, Oddly paced and emotionally flat.,0
41415, An effort that is full of gosh-wow moments.,1
50163," The film is far from what could've been, but the things it does right are enough to get you interested. [Full review in Spanish]",1
63553, A mark of tremendous insight that plays like another notch in the social dashboard from which Werner Herzog continues to find his inspiration.,1
56584," Even if the film had been 30 minutes or less, this comedy would still be too long.",0
27709," ... winds up resembling its protagonist - sort of sweet and well-intentioned, but ultimately oblivious and dorky.",0
44212, Leaning into the Wind: Andy Goldsworthy feels like a twilight look at Goldsworthy. That's not to say that the artist's productivity has in any way diminished.,1
79708, Even as it makes a show of complexity Fragments seems determined to pull together its various story strands.,0
63606, For all my hesitation and reluctance to embrace it personally I can?t wait to watch it again.,1
39981, Snakes was the best instantly disposable cinematic event I've attended since Bride of Chucky was launched on an unsuspecting world eight years ago.,1
3001, A multi-generational romantic comedy is a rare and precious thing to behold.,1
37398," In an admirably self-aware decision, this overhaul of the splatter classic The Evil Dead doesn't have the ""the"" in its title. This isn't ""The"" Evil Dead but another one, a lesser, nastier one, with all of the original's high-camp fun hemorrhaged out.",0
7082," There are some jump scares, one highly predictable twist, and a fair amount of violence, but ""The Purge"" pretty much begins and ends with its concept.",0
62890," Writer-director Francis Lee captures not only what masculinity does and how it comes undone, but the complex apparatus that keeps it into place: the family's surveillance, the silence, the shame.",1
45159," The most the James Wan film has is ear-piercing sound effects with quick cuts to scary faces. Of course you'll jump, but you'll also jump if someone runs behind you and screams in your eardrum -- this is the same effect as 'Insidious.'",0
77557," ... In this house, ""D"" is for dull.",0
44521, One problem with having so many skeletons in the family closet is that skeletons all tend to look the same.,0
52063," A fun and sweet romantic comedy that lands comfortably on the smart side of vacant, along the way offering a pleasant and satisfying diversion for the grown-ups in the room.",1
27221," A remarkably convincing examination of heroism, hero worship, and the seductive allure of villainy.",1
68557," Beautiful Boy is an ambitious film, one that hopes to make known the exhausting heartbreak of addiction. Unfortunately, it ends up simply exhausting.",0
22308," Strip away all the marks of prestige, and it's about as deep and as realistic as a Lifetime movie, reduced to just another predictable homage to the power of forgiveness. ",0
42329," An involving film that disturbs on the deepest levels as tensions mount, words ricochet like bullets and actions speak louder than words",1
29406," An infuriating exercise in geek-baiting populated by unlikable characters that grows more frustrating through its 113 minutes, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is more like a feature-length adaptation of Reality Bites: The Video Game.",0
35698," For all of its faults, there's still plenty here to praise, the result of so much being thrown at the wall is that some of it will stick.",1
41199, A strong Noomi Rapace performance and some solid action are balanced by an underwhelming ending.,1
23180," One of those movies that sits in an armchair, smokes a pipe and reflects ""seriously"" on ""the question of violence,"" but the main reason to see it is for the hilariously nasty uses it devises for a bear trap, nail gun, etc.",0
72481, Garrone's roaming camera style draws you into each moment with extreme close-ups and long takes that wander through each scene and get lost in it. Luciano's plight is crushing because Garrone renders it with such detail.,1
63658," Once again, Spike Lee has found an innovative theatrical production and brought it to blistering cinematic life.",1
37162," Despite...drawbacks, Mr. Peabody & Sherman captures much of the manic, surrealistic fun of the original cartoons.",1

11293," Doesn't come close to matching any of the legion of films set in the country music world, from ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" to ""Walk the Line"" to ""Crazy Heart.""",0
46168, ...a perfectly watchable (and consistently hackneyed) feel-good ensemble drama.,1
57377," By no means a balanced presentation of l'affaire LeRoy, much less an indictment of Laura Albert. But it nonetheless assembles a large amount of fascinating material...even if it sidesteps the issue of ultimate narrative reliability. ",1
21776," If it sounds a bit ponderous, well, maybe it is, but it's also smart, warm-hearted and sumptuously shot.",1
12256, ... The best non-Pixar animated movie in recent memory ...,1
64844," A painfully melodramatic take on world events, working to welcome audiences into bleak territory through a romantic tale of lost lovers, and the fantasy doesn't mesh with reality.",0
52649, Shyamalan concocts a clever premise and delivers one of the most suspenseful thrillers this decade bolstered by an outstanding turn by McAvoy.,1
74638," That American Hustle is set in the '70s is the perfect coincidence, for it is a movie that would have fit right into the ""New Hollywood"" of that era where directors were king, actors went beyond the pale and stories had balls. ",1
74887," As he explores the resistance of assimilation and how vastly different cultures can have a shared bond, Mikhanovsky has a unique voice, but hopefully it's better honed in his next film.",0
39193," The first half of Molly's Game features some of Sorkin's best ever screenwriting - and in Chastain, an actress who can digest his dense dialogue as easy as somebody reading the phonebook.",1

55199," Left without a heart of its own, this Sea flounders.",0
33429," As a feat of filmmaking chutzpah, it's one of 2015's most intriguing offerings.",1
29217," Though the visuals are often gorgeous, the dramatic elements don't always work quite as well as they should because there is not enough attention given to them.",0
19452," Brutal and brilliant, ""Son of Saul"" may be the most harrowing film ever made about the Holocaust, which should give you an idea of how hard it is to watch.",1
9801, Any questions about Miller's abilities as an actress should be set to rest by this performance.,1
77982," Remember those old '30s musicals that generated sizzle out of backstage machinations, charismatic producers conning investors and starstruck unknowns hitting the big time? That's how Moneyball plays...",1
33982," Surveillance starts interesting, gets ugly, and ends kind of boring.",0
34138," For its first hour, ""A Ghost Story"" is a top-notch contribution to the grief genre. It's right up there with ""Truly Madly Deeply."" ",1
72591," Spike Island is a film that does more or less precisely what you expect it to do - no more, and no less - and within that limited remit, it's a gentle and affable watch.",1
49193, The Tall Man comes as close as anything in recent years at matching the better monster-of-the-week episodes of The X-Files.,1
51740," The film is uniquely incurious about Van Gogh himself beyond the myth of what he represents, which is the last quality we need in a Van Gogh film anymore.",0
19281, The stuffed animals are more expressive than the real actors. [Full review in Spanish],0
62937," One of those comedies about supposedly ordinary people of at least average intelligence who nonetheless spend the entire movie being frantic, bumbling morons.",0
34858," With a magnificent performance from Ethan Hawke, Sinister provides the authentic scares the horror junkie in you has been craving all year long.",1
55752," Be it colour, composition or movement %u2013 Ford seems to have a natural ability to use the camera to create a vivid but tasteful milieu that works as both an eye-catching palette and an expressive representation of grief.",1
8092, ...reminds us how easily the awful past can be repeated in the present.,1
8926," The film itself just isn't very engaging, in part because Portman is so frustratingly passive for much of it.",0
49011," Not necessarily the best film, those who remember the original series and have an interest in pop culture humor should find something in Josie to enjoy.",1
22762," The deep, dark sadness of Haynes' movie casts a beautiful, powerful spell.",1
56346," At its best, this lewder, cruder spin on last year's ""Sex Drive"" has a disarmingly daffy shaggy-dog touch a la ""Half-Baked"" or ""The Brothers Solomon."" But by the time a woman enjoys champagne spiked with dog urine, ""Miss March"" is all turn-offs.",0
83539," Beneath all the silk and powder, it transpires that Stoker is actually nothing more than a schlocky, screeching B-movie; an animated skeleton sent up to spook us. It's at its most entertaining when it shakes off its clothes.",1
57624," Failing to generate either excitement as a crime story or credibility as a morality play, the film ultimately confirms the traditional values that helped push its confused lead to the brink of damnation in the first place.",0
75310," This is basically an inferior version of [Legally Blonde], and it isn't even up to the standards of last year's similarly plotted Amanda Bynes comedy Sydney White.",0
17520, Only glances the skin but never gets under it.,1

28249, It just feels painfully low-budget.,0
56900," The cast are fully believable, and the landscape - Jordan filling in for Afghanistan, as it did for Saudi Arabia in the recent release Theeb - provides another character, implacable and indifferent. War may be hell, but hell can be starkly beautiful too.",1
12307," It's become something of a snarky joke about emotionally manipulative entertainment, but when you can honestly say ""I laughed, I cried,"" somebody's doing something right.",1
14336," Some viewers will get unintended jollies from a gigantic, rampaging grasshopper; others, from the director's queasy-making penchant for unclothing his exhibitionist daughter Asia.",0
18625, The sheer unpredictability is fun to watch and its musical soundtrack glorious to hear,1
42931," Like a nice, if unassuming, suit tailored by a team of craftsman.",1
11037, [A] dull actioner.,0
68932," Because the overly ambitious storyline lacks clarity, the film lacks the pulse-pounding energy of the original. What heart there is comes from the family drama among Jake, Winnie, and Gordon. ",0
56024," Despite the serious subject matter, director Brian Robbins can't decide whether this is a drama, a satire or an American Pie-style teen spoof, and the film dissolves into a shapeless, weightless mass.",0
72299," ... it is, at times, tedious. [Full review in Spanish]",0
23201, The film dishes oodles of sex and drugs but skimps on the rock 'n' roll.,0
20465," As a reproduction of the stage show, Chicago isn't bad, but it makes no persuasive case for itself as a film.",0
50074," It's still not fantastic. But I wouldn't be surprised if, eventually, there weren't four of these.",0

18849," Though unabashedly goofy, this comedy also boasts some subtly ingenious moments of mirth.",1
679, Capshaw is cold and charmless!,0
38979," It seems that none of the filmmakers stopped to think on what they were doing. Yes, it's flashy and dynamic, maybe it works to keep children very young. [Full review in Spanish]",0
13437, Ted is raunchy and funny as you might expect but it's also surprisingly sweet natured. Quite a fun and satisfying first feature from MacFarlane.,1
6175, Valiant is a movie that is trying to be an homage but winds up a pale imitation.,0
48578," Regrettably, Widows forgets that it is - first and foremost - supposed to be a believable heist flick.",0
73189, It's a shame that such a didactic script and the attachment of Brian Singer taints what could have been a genuine and touching story.,0
58318, The movie culminates with a sloppily edited car chase that goes on for so long that I had to be reminded: Was Matt Damon playing Jason Bourne or Sheriff Buford T. Justice?,0
47677," Stylistically, Blade Runner is the Citizen Kane of sci-fi movies.",1
76785," As much a history of modern Pakistan as a portrait of the political dynasty that periodically led the country over two decades, Bhutto offers a complex and sometimes confounding perspective on its titular family. ",1
23939," Rize is uplifting without being manipulative, and if -- at 85 minutes -- it is a little longer than it needs to be, LaChapelle is clearly committed to giving these dancers every possible moment of glory.",1
59048, A bland screwball comedy sunk by an excess of gimmickry and a lack of credibility and punch.,0
10950," One of my favorite films of its year, and far and away my favorite of this type of film. (And, yes, I include Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films in that assessment.)",1
35630," Well-done, if not particularly groundbreaking from a filmmaking standpoint, nor does it tell us a lot that we didn't know already about the court's liberal lion. (Broad Street Review)",1
65026, It's a blurry vision that comes into focus only intermittently.,0
28422," ""Search Party"" is a pedal-to-the-metal road trip that aims for spontaneity, but stays within the lines-even when it goes off on wacky tangents, there's never any doubt what direction it's actually headed.",0
63579, This misleadingly titled tale of a dentist who sees dead people attempts to be a supernatural romantic-comedy in the manner of the old TOPPER movies from the '30s.,1
13343," While all of Gilliam's movies are worth seeing, there's a fair amount of his designer grimness here mixed in with the cabaret comedy.",1
27402, Predictable but thoroughly entertaining and largely accurate story of the greatest racehorse of all time.,1
66932," Precisely the kind of heady, ambitious effort Malick fans have long awaited from the former Harvard philosophy student and MIT philosophy professor.",1
60846," You hear what the film is saying, but the presentation is at arm's length from its own ideals.",0
1370, It's not a great movie by any means.,0
8786," It's complex, and enjoyable, although not exactly moral...there are a sufficient amount of twists that keep you guessing in a fun way.",1
3169," I was quietly blown away by Daniel Cross's new documentary I Am the Blues, which follows the Montrealer on a quest through the southern U.S. to track down the last remaining ambassadors of the genre.",1
5157," A gluttonous buffet of Sundance clich√©s, with an acid-reflux aftertaste of condescension and unexamined racism.",0
22609," For all the OTT schlock spectacle and community-theater-quality performances, there's a tangible bond between the characters that gathers emotive momentum toward a surprisingly touching coda.",0
42483," Denis Villeneuve is, unquestionably, one of the most exciting directors working today.",1
49286, This love letter to Valentino from director Matt Tyrnauer seems intended for the already smitten.,1
6672," Above-average thriller, but not very memorable.",1
25536, Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell a hit with the little ones!,1
77024," Yes, ""Hugo'' is a family film and, yes, your children and your inner child stand to be enraptured, but the family Scorsese really made this for is the 100-year-old tribe of watchers in the dark.",1
812," As with Fothergill's previous nature documentaries, ""Bears"" is a story of triumph and family.",1
27753," Beyond implausible, but it works as a live-action cartoon.",1
61164," What makes ""High Flying Bird"" so welcome and unexpected is its combination of immediacy and drama.",1
47681," Butler's regular-guyness makes the character more likable than he should be; but Heigl, for all her screen presence, looks great but seems stiff, as if she's uncomfortable with the wilder physical comedy of the character.",0
41575, Amy Sedaris is a dementedly funny horror as Jerri Blank (in) the aggressively politically incorrect prequel to the cult Comedy Central series.,1
33285, Beatriz at Dinner works well beyond both lecture or lesson because of the care and attention everyone has put into the people that play them out.,1
9618, A particularly high point for mid-2010's art cinema.,1
27325," an unfunny, more conventionally ""likable"" version of Margot at the Wedding",1
42277," Those with a high tolerance for good-natured ""teen"" raunch could do worse.",1
2544, Refreshingly stripped-down.,1
20814," My Life As A Zucchini takes on heavy subject matter with a light hand, and comes up with a delightful tale that is equal parts wrenching and uplifting.",1
70439," Troy may not be the stuff of legends, but on the whole it's still a very good action-adventure movie.",1
81383," This is one clumsy cannabis comedy that couldn't give the late Timothy Leary a natural high worth experiencing! Nip this ""joint"" session in the bud!",0
64970," If a white filmmaker were behind the wretched ugliness that is The Wash, he'd be branded the most racist director since D.W. Griffith.",0
8452," A novel but muddled supervillain action movie...Some comic-book fans will lap it up, but Suicide Squad is all sauce and no meat.",0
65379, It's this mature take on the subject matter that makes Lore the finest Australian film of the year.,1
45190," The film is neither elegant nor subtle. Both Eastwood's performance and his direction veer from broad melodrama to broader comedy and back again. But the film boasts crusty humor, heart and conscience.",1
67582," Movie metaphor junkies be on high alert, for a horny Dr. Phil, Michael Jackson hiding out in a car trunk with a little boy and a pet chimp for good measure, and a bad imitation Juno blasting lactating breast milk as a deadly weapon.",0
2648," It's rare, but sometimes one talented star can make any project shine. Amy Adams is that talented.",1
74107," Both as parable and personal drama, the film leaves something to be desired.",0
54388," Thirty-plus years on, this tale of five teens trapped in a cabin in the woods being pursued by dark, supernatural forces just seems familiar and silly, with Alvarez doing little to breathe new life into the genre.",0
2040," Spoiled, self-obsessed, VanDyke only achieves brief flickers of awareness in his quest to complete the ""crash course in manhood"" that eventually led him to fight alongside Libyan rebels in 2011.",0
61544," Sure, it's an ages-old dilemma and there are moments that feel very much like a first film. But the strong lead performance by Aml Ameen (""Sense8"") lends shading and depth to Onah's story.",1
45374," It feels contrived -- often clever and sometimes funny but always self-conscious, one of those indie flicks where the damn quirkiness is plastered on and right in your face. It's like an architect making the gargoyles the centrepiece of his church.",0
57908," ""A Most Violent Year"" is a small picture, but each brushstroke is laden with detail and craftsmanship.",1
38609," I think ""White House Down"" is a little better than ""Olympus Has Fallen."" The plot of each of these films is far-fetched, but ""White House Down"" has the more interesting characters and doesn't take itself so seriously.",1
56513," Don't worry about fearing darkness, but beware horror flicks that trot out every hoary clich√©.",0
82482, Gary Oldman is quietly wonderful as John le Carre's George Smiley. But this subtle and sly film lacks dramatic punch. ,1
39692," Lane and Gear ensure that Nights in Rodanthe is never less than watchable, but it's scuppered by an overly sentimental script and fails to deliver the required emotional punch.",0
7291," James Cameron has gone and delivered a spectacular, moving, utterly engrossing three-and-a-bit hour epic.",1
35445," Playing Coco's orphaned beginnings like a violin, writer/director Anne Fontaine shows a sure hand when it comes to emotional button-pushing.",1
51340," The tonal shift undoes what amounts to one of the more interesting origins of a serial killer in the making. A thriller without much thrills, Beast is a thought-provoking character study and sort of a dark fairy tale.",0
81014," The people in this future are shallow, selfish and depressing.",0
72485," Eager to please but ultimately unable to do so..While it will undoubtedly produce the waterworks, the laughs are a little harder to come by.",0
70524," Unless you are prone to laugh at endless urination, expectoration, regurgitation, defecation, flatulence, and belching, avoid this rip-off at all costs.",0
8939," Johnny Depp affects an accent that's so exaggeratedly British he sounds like a one-man Pimm's advertisement as Mortdecai, a dimwit toff art dealer with a taste for port and a moustache that would get him laughed out of Shoreditch.",0
50680," By opting against a graphic depiction of the characters' carnal consummation, it causes that spark of first love Elio is coming to terms with to linger more pervasively. That warmth exuding from the screen is ""Call Me by Your Name's"" gift to you.",1
72857," ...a compelling and insightful glimpse into the convergence of perpetual teenage issues with modern high school athletics, with the entertainment value extending far beyond basketball fans.",1
71876, Though it's disappointing to see Goldthwait step away from the conceptual audacity of his previous work ... Willow Creek does everything a little bit better than others of its kind.,1
9351," a kinetic art piece of color, sound, and movement that exists somewhere between the Underworld movies and Matthew Barney's Cremaster Cycle, with just a hint of Tron thrown in.",1
44668," [Marc Forster]is constrained by reality, and so is left with a story that lacks much of a satisfying climax or anything like a proper ending. ",0
78215," Stilted and steeped in uninspired biopic tropes, the film never comes close to an inventiveness worthy of JT's imaginative, outrageous story.",0
15062, I used to think it was a good thing that Malick made movies like no one else's. Maybe he should try being a bit more derivative next time.,0
75490," Over and over, American Honey calls attention to how observant it is, rather than just being observant.",0
66019," Arthouse martial-arts action that's incredibly dull even when it's being pornographic about its extreme bloody violence, and doesn't even bother with the nominally original one-location conceit of the first film.",0
69437," This thriller by Jon Avnet is mostly by the numbers, and its surprise ending, though effective, feels somewhat forced.",0
30067," Its matter-of-fact tone, juxtaposed with its eerie, plausible subject matter, should prove compelling viewing for those in the mood to watch it.",1
45391," It advances the story and respects mythos of its comic book creations, yet isn't averse to taking risks and moving it into bolder directions.",1
6359," But where Romero goes for the cheap, linear approach, Argento's storytelling is painfully poetic, with ever-shifting points of view and asides... There's a madness in Argento's method and it's always appropriate.",1
77552, As emotionally rich as it is intellectually demanding.,1
15550, Even with fairly good special effects the movie is boring; let's hope the indicated sequel(s) doesn't see the light of day.,0
80346, I fought to like it...a battle that I lost.,0
5089, Give the film this much: it's egalitarian in its imbecility.,1
70351, An unfunny French comedy with unappealing characters.,0
67656, What is radical about Nichols's film is the extent to which he focuses not on the legal fight and ensuing national attention but on the Lovings themselves.,1
60493," Enjoyable, emotionally engaging and frequently amusing romcom with a charming central performance from Ryan Reynolds and superb support from Abigail Breslin and the three lead actresses.",1
16525," This Hitchcock classic somehow strayed from favour for a while, yet in the realm of popular mythology it is now rivalled only by Vertigo or Psycho.",1
21843, Offers up exciting action set pieces and a rousing finale to the somewhat overlong series.,1
21569," This mafia story without urbanity, is tinged with an overwhelming predictability, guided by an insistent and explanatory voice over, built on characters that are consumed in the same archetypes that inspire them. [Full Review in Spanish]",0
67301," Nice, clean entertainment but maybe too sweet for anyone over twelve",0
55035, Clint Eastwood scores again with this tale of Mandela and his idea to bring unity to South Africa through rugby. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon provide the acting clout while Eastwood shapes the direction of the film.,1
61277, This aimless travelogue isn't worthy of the killer Cameron Crowe soundtrack that comes along with it.,0
35124, Slight but satisfying.,1
77759," If only Maloof and Siskel had focused less on gossipy psychological guesswork, and more on Maier's art, this could've been a documentary worthy of its towering subject.",0
32645," Mikkel Norgaard, the director, propels the story by smartly sticking to the formula he used in the previous film: hints of menace, gorgeously shadowed shots and long flashbacks.",1
83693, Kids will eat Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie up. The rest of us will have to wait for the translation.,0
78063, Gil is a serene and compassionate figure although the film only offers sketchy information on his life and career.,1
23444," This film suffers slightly from that: while it may not be the most compelling story-frankly, it's a tad esoteric-it is absolutely visually breathtaking.",1
52255," Despite its occasional slack, Southbound is still tightly knotted where so many other films of its type are frayed at the seams.",1
44943, The filmmaker's intended target is clear. Less so? What the film has to say about another faith-based group in 2017.,1
1182," Does Eddie Murphy actually have any range, or is it just an illusion created by a few early edgy roles and, later, a lot of CGI makeup and fat suits?",0
5860, Many critics regard it as the very best film of the Eighties.,1
35636," Ultimately inexplicable, this concentrated, elliptical, economical movie is an experience that never loses its strangeness.",1
60464," Provocateur LaBute not only dramatically throws the 'c' word at us in this film, but he also goes to great lengths to show us one.",1
53265, This bittersweet drama is a sharply observed tale of middle-aged reconciliation and redemption that's both sad and charming.,1
54939, Doesn't work as a goodbye to Kirk or as a hello to Picard.,0
28118," While lacking the complexity of the greater works it clearly admires, Cut Bank is a serviceable adventure with some genuine surprises.",1
13312," A Wrinkle in Time is about traveling through time and space, but it is also itself an act of time travel.",1
74731," Why does Cinderella seem extra-ordinary instead of extraordinary? Perhaps it's because we're so familiar with the story that this by-the-book, new version comes off as solid but not spectacular.",0
43589, Nothing is permitted to get in the way of letting the star unleash his trademark exaggerated facial expressions and out-of-left-field line readings. ...There's really only one person up there on the screen; everyone else might as well be wallpaper.,1
68972," Not everything works in this semi-audacious challenge to the American Dream, but Weitz consistently and amusingly hits the broad side of the barn.",1
51278, Could it be that Hugh Grant was born to play a villainous dandy in a kid's movie?,1
47056," There are no characters, only types, and Solondz doesn't seem to have affection for any of them.",0
44971," Credit should also go to the fierce-eyed Youngblood and Hernandez for making their onscreen relationship so believable. And youngster Baez is completely natural, which is even more incredible when you consider that he's speaking an ancient language.",1
59249," But for a movie that wants to tell you this unbelievable story about a smart guy, ""The Catcher Was a Spy"" shows its hand with faux-intellectualism. ",0
64607, Moderately entertaining for the first hour and then for the last half hour goes up in flames.,0
62221," [W]riter/director Ari Aster, making his feature debut, takes us through a chilling exploration of mourning and madness.",1
82919," t's worth noting at this point that in real life, a good number of people, most of them doctors, have gone to jail for fraudulently inseminating women.",0
81338," Fans will welcome the mostly reverent translation, but the uninitiated will find the movie cramped and static.",1
40296, Night Watch is narratively confused if visually robust. The picture doesn't work as a standalone story but it sets the stage for a potentially interesting second chapter.,0
75528," Paradox is choppy and directionless, better seen as an experimental concert film that attempted to do something more ambitious than the average music video.",0
1413," The result is not just an examination of showbiz for aging actress versus emerging starlets, but a treatise on how we examine and judge the fictional choices of fictional characters as opposed to the choices we make in so-called reality. ",1
78802," For much of its length, Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby has the terrible endlessness of films where everything is too short. We are jabbed with effect after effect, in our faces and up our noses in 3D",0
70255, This is filmmaking at its most powerful.,1
54678," Best's fame had percolated to the farthest corners of consciousness, beyond soccer to stardom. And that was his curse, and his blessing.",1
43398," Magic and realism meet in this transporting, immersive tale set in the wilds of south Louisiana. ",1
39910," This is the beginning of a series, and it offers passable entertainment for fans, but let's hope it gets better.",0
62076, Approaches such niceties as construction and character motivation with a decidedly wanton shrug.,0
65432," What makes The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby truly stand apart from all the other films of its kind...is the emotional depth that is allowed to be dug by the film's premise and length, executed almost perfectly",1
66251," Bring your Dramamine, because you're going to need it.",0
1830," After Kidman and Ferrell have hit all the expected marks (meet cute, encounter obstacles, fall in love, encounter fatal setback, fall back in love), the movie winds up being hoist on its own petard, becoming the butt of one of its own inside jokes.",0
83107," From a deep-fat fryer of Brangelina publicity comes not a greasy meal, but a solid summer souffle that crackles thanks to great chemistry, good action and an inventive score.",1
62669, This Korean action-thriller is more everything than the John Wick films and Atomic Blonde put together.,1
38561," Despite Tony Scott managing to maintain his high-octane style, the relative simplicity of the plot gives Unstoppable a more intimate feel than his usual bombastic actioner",1
32878, 'Shrek 2' is amusing enough - little kids will adore it and there are enough laughs to keep the elders amused as well.,1
66250," Singer's take on ye olde yarne has wit about it, and it certainly looks good.",1
56197, The clashing titans in Clash of the Titans are a pretty sorry lot.,0
75056," Curiously, rookie director Dean Wright can't seem to make a struggle for one of the most basic rights all that interesting.",0
26682, A mostly motion-capture movie featuring the Mother of all battles.,1
75966," The source material ends up shoehorned between splashy images of springboks and hippos, and any gaps are filled with CGI. But when adapting an acclaimed book, it's probably smart to let the plot steal the show.",0
12622," It's like a sweater that's been pulled at from the top and bottom - it's so spread out that you can't see anything any more but the holes, even if you really wanted to admire the design.",0
18829," This is Depp's coming-of-age role, and he's terrific. Pacino, who's shown more flash than substance recently, reminds us how great he can be when he loses himself inside a character. ",1
33017," It retains enough moments of twangy gallows humour, mostly courtesy of Paul Le Mat as Leon's corpulent drinking buddy, to keep the film from becoming a bludgeoning experience.",1
64608," Even with new cooks in the kitchen, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 is a completely delicious dish, as it adds a handful of great new ingredients to a familiar recipe.",1
82608, X2 has some surprisingly touching moments and some surprises to boot.,1
15940, This is one of the best films of 2015.,1
33621, a cracking-good crime story almost perfectly told,1
47426," If you are looking for something more intellectual, and certainly more accurate in its portrayal of a rich period in English history, you will have to go elsewhere.",0
37022," Efrons new movie isnt going to become a classic, but its a well acted film, it feels honest and at least is inspired. [Full review in Spanish]",1
59366, This Oscar-winning Best Picture still has the power and appeal that won audiences over back in 1960.,1
60723," Whatever ambitions Johnston might have had for the picture, they aren't realized on the screen.",0
45682," There's no beauty to this film, little rhythm, none of the physical grace that action-film fans crave even if they don't know they do. ",0
73634," A mixed bag of strengths and wekanesses, this adaptation of the 1930s Brit novel has charming moments but also cloying artificiality and is not as frothy and fun as it wants to be.",0
53464," The rules of the gang are spurious enough to make us realise that this isn't a world of good against evil, it's a world of adolescents who've got no reason to grow up.",1
76445," If [Showalter's] acting is misjudged, his direction is merely uninspired.",0
15182," While making a political, historical biopic, Van Sant managed, concurrently, to make a visually beautiful, emotionally thrilling and surprisingly personal work of art.",1
25959," As the overlong pic wears on, it's hard to care whether the puzzle pieces of the protags' lives fall into place or not.",0
12258," Unfortunately, the film ultimately peters out rather than coming to a satisfactorily disquieting conclusion.",0
2255, There's an exhilarating sadness to it all that amounts to cinematic poetry.,1
8817," It's an unhappy ending, the wrong unhappy ending for this film. ",0
34967," This movie is a cloying, over-the-top, cheesy sing-a-long that makes ""Glee"" seem subtle.",0
37995," The characters aren't much more well-defined than the anonymous victims of a teen horror movie... The dinosaur effects, however, are absolutely stunning, and sometimes so natural that one even forgets to be impressed.",1
27592," The film is about as indie as indie movies get, with a homemade, washed-out look that drives home the genuineness of the performances.",1
57910," Of course, it would also help if we could understand what's supposed to be so alluring about the title character, Antoinette de Langeais.",0
19837," Intimacy rushes into the story with cool command: Haley is increasingly masterful with domestic tempos.... Haley hails toward its greatest virtues: the human face, the human voice, elemental longings.",1
61241," Wingard was in high school when ""The Blair Witch Project"" came out, so he's checking something off his personal list here. Everyone else moved on from ""Blair Witch,"" with good reason, a long time ago.",0
47867," The biggest film of the year opens this week, though you may be forgiven if you haven't heard about it, as it has committed the unpardonable sin of being in Chinese.",1
67679," With a big assist from Hanks, Spielberg takes nothing and turns it into a charming something.",1
48462," None of what transpires is earth-shattering, but it's the way it happens, with the simplicity and sense of wonder of an old-fashioned picture book, that makes her story, however wispy, delightful.",1
27480," Chanu, a torrent of frustration who seems to be no more happy with the union than his wife is, confronts Karim in a memorable scene that packs a spark the rest of the film lacks.",0
61356," The documentary proves to be an uncomfortably admiring advertisement for its subject, and a narrowly focused one at that.",0
18486, The Man arrives in theaters today with a sheet over its head and a tag on its toe.,0
74668," The ride is engrossing. And successful, in that it is bound to leave most viewers with a better grasp of the sequence of events that unfolded in 2008.",1
57710," It's not a film, it's a bland, overly long sitcom straining for the funny ... something along the lines of Two and A Half Men-tal Cases.",0
83851," Like ""Let's Twist Again,"" it can't play the same familiar chords with lesser lyrics and expect the same results. It isn't quite the revved-up rallying call for outcasts that the first one was, so this sequel is best approached with lower expectations.",0
69334," This movie is everything Hancock wanted to be, but failed to deliver.",1
62506, The Last Witch Hunter might be the worst video game adaptation not actually based on a video game,0
18387," The film teases us with a paradox: arguably Nim's keepers were wrong to try to endow their protege with human attributes, but can we empathise with his suffering without making the same mistake?",1
20196," Garner may justify her reputation as an action woman, but fails to prove that sais matter.",0
2952," It makes a shameless bid for your heart, aiming to have you smiling one moment, sniffling the next.",1
5158, The main draw here is the action sequences. Other than that Rampage provides no novelties despite another charming performance from The Rock. [Full Review in Spanish],0
47795, We could not possibly care less.,0
21333, The stench of needlessly convoluted derivativeness lingers throughout this flick.,0
59663," It's entertaining in the way that a good musical comedy, whether it's Singing in the Rain, or Hairspray, is entertaining. Full of color, energy, and unpretentious confidence.",1
59689," For my money, anything short of an Oscar for Bridges would be a sin. I'd also call it the best movie of 2009.",1
78176, Enough of the bits work and some are so funny that the overall effort comes off as contagiously enjoyable and often hilariously entertaining.,1
38722, A striking and at times uncomfortably personal feature debut from writer-director Eva Vives that makes good on its title by not shying away from the emotional damage that makes its protagonist so compelling.,1
60936," Leigh is as interested as Turner in the elusive, the evocative and the essential. ",1
40249," The ending battle between The Hulk and Abomination is one of the most spectacular and exciting things I've ever seen on screen. If the downtown Los Angeles robot battles of Transformers impressed you, this puts those to shame.",1
6656, The use of the chador in Under the Shadow is one example of how the film successfully manages to be both a serious reflection on the position of women in Iran and an intensely creepy horror film.,1
61639, Mostly the laughs are based in behavior and character. Carell once again displays the range that makes him something more than just another funny guy. Binoche is so appealing that you immediately understand why Dan has been smitten.,1
29933, Perhaps the most honest depiction of a relationship gone sour that has ever been committed to celluloid.,1
2951," This Footloose takes place in the same authentic, sweaty, lived-in South as his Hustle & Flow and Black Snake Moan.",1
66725, Wait until Francis Ford Coppola gets a load of this gem. It is every bit the movie that his long gestating On the Road should become.,1
61708," These days you can barely swing a chainsaw without hitting a zombie-based movie or TV show, but Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse doesn't further the undead cause one iota.",0

7862," If you are looking for substance, then this one has no logic, only magic. But, if you're looking to just laugh and be merry, Golmaal will again do the trick. ",1
31808," Having lost all intrigue by the sub-standard third act, the picture becomes a sluggish chore that takes far too long to reach its dopey finish.",0
4863, A solid yet fleet French thriller about a society kidnapping and its shockwaves.,1
46096," Naturally, Koepp makes it his business to redeem this unpleasant character and recast him as an acceptable stand-in for a romantic lead. But cynics should not despair; it's not a complete makeover.",1
57181," When they cross the line into noncomic violence and torture with me, I'm done being amused.",0
40613," Without an element of true discovery, however, Among The Believers is a cinematically, and artistically, flat result.",0
57573, Alien: Covenant should please diehard fans but it needs a better script and more interesting characters if they are thinking of stretching out the series to yet another instalment.,1
58372," Shakespeare in Love moves fast, and may deserve multiple viewings. It's a delicious feast of lowbrow and highbrow mixed with romance.",1
61693," What ensues is ""Beaches"" meets ""Pineapple Express."" Which, I've got to tell you, is pretty much what living with cancer is like.",1
5711," Though short in characterization and emotional involvement, this complex tale is gripping and beautiful.** ",1
13655," Newcomer Brooklynn Prince is pure magic; a firecracker of intensity and confidence, this girl is a star.",1

45216, When Tyrnauer concentrates on the life of consensual pleasure - often told with Bowers' salty tongue from his giggly recollections - then Scotty is more fun than a sock hop.,1
45916," This tuneful, joyful and emotional spectacle is filled with razzle-dazzle and wonder.",1
61173, The Day the Earth Stood Still is a great study in all the things that can go wrong with a movie. The plot's all haywire and the casting's rotten and the dialogue's stupid and the camerawork's ugly and the CGI sucks.,0
27477, Cranston changes his character from regular Joe to raging psycho - and you believe it utterly. He's extraordinary. Too bad the movie settles for being same old/same old. ,0
54466," Infinitely Polar Bear often approaches mental illness as a wacky inconvenience, but Mark Ruffalo's appealingly full-on performance as manic-depressive father Cam Stuart prods the movie into overcoming some shortcomings.",1
80726, It would be fair to say that Skyscraper does what it sets out to do but the unambitious agenda isn't something I'm especially interested in watching.,0
23445," A wolf council with dubbed growls may be the most ludicrous scene of the year, but a rumble with chic vampires punching CGI werewolves comes close.",0
6606, Terrifying from start to blood-soaked finish.,1
35148," A skilful piece of storytelling that reorganises time and, in a characteristic Almod√≥var fashion, challenges our preconceptions about everyday life and personal conduct.",1
71929," Overblown, stupid, loud, unfunny, and completely maddening in its undisguised assumption that you'll swallow this nonsense whole.",0
52848," This is no perfect -- or even half-perfect -- game. It's another movie where conventions are subbed for life lessons, where the emotions are cued by golden oldies and where the motivation (at least on the studio's part) isn't love of the game but money.",0

21158," Compelling film, filled with human pathos. ",1
36643," At some points the film lags, loses focus, especially in the segues between vignettes where you can hear the gears creak. Thank goodness it's so pretty to look at, and it is fun to count the references to classic films.",1
4658, It isn't based on a book series. But it feels like it is. And perhaps it should be. ,0

3381, Australia is what you get when the film projector overheats and the only thing that comes out is pure corn syrup.,0
28144," It brings me no pleasure to be disappointed by a brand new Puppet Master movie that has some of my favorite actors, screenwriters, and composers attached, but here we are.",0
67554," Eye-catching though both performances are, Byzantium remains an indecisive oddity with Jordan's rhythm of reverie never quite finding its groove.",0
11582," Carrey delivers a disappointing performance, the sort of calculated turn we had come to routinely expect from Robin Williams until his recent dramatic awakening.",0
38986," [Spielberg] is valuable, but leaves the feeling that, with a little more audacity and irreverence, it could have been a lot better. [Full Review in Spanish] ",1
76778, It's all so neatly laid out yet so lacking in the type of detail that would give it emotional soul. Even the dog Stacie so yearns for and gets with Laurel goes MIA once it's served its purpose.,0
71427, Such is the immediacy and authenticity of The Jungle Book's spellbinding imagery that you barely notice the storytelling never quite comes together in the same satisfying way.,1
72897," It's a powerful and haunting introduction to Grisebach's work, and certainly one would hope that the wait for a new film (this is her first film in over a decade) won't be anywhere near as long. ",1

8688," A mature, small-scaled drama that's both insightful and affecting.",1
58767," Room has the combined talents of Larson, Allen and Tremblay behind it, but it boasts a banality that robs it of the punch that it needs. This is low impact cinema, but not entirely without its merits.",0
68292, The Punisher is not a good movie.,0
9342," Here to prove that misogyny never quite goes out of style in the cinema, French director Bertrand Bonello presents this wearisome, questionable spectacle.",0
58384," Anderson's woodsy thought process... elicits a thorough batch of the rainy summer daydreams where most grand childhood adventures and romances are so often had: in heads and hearts, if not in flesh.",1
20395," An unfortunate misfire that has the odd moment of charm and the odder chuckle, but otherwise isn't worth keeping up with.",0
35956," The film has no pace, no style and no sense of forward momentum. Rockwell is given lots of narration in an attempt to glue it all together, but it doesn't help.",0
8344," Focussed, fun and faithful to the lore, Solo is a worthy and entertaining expansion of the Star Wars universe. ",1
39924," Notable chiefly for its knowing, comfortable depictions of female relationships, sibling relationships, familial relationships. Also its determination to rise above some of its more sitcommy plot points.",1
69143, Welcome back Indy. Lord knows we've missed you.,1
16386," I didn't know that apartments still sell for pittances in the city's superheated market, but it's only one of many details that don't ring true in a movie that gives you time to wonder about such things in between the plodding plot points.",0

11133, You can practically smell the stale beer in Everybody Wants Some!! But do we really wanna drink it?,0
29561, I'd say that as a whole this was a successful project by Eli Roth. There are obviously aspects of the film that did not work within the context of the story.,1
79811," Consistently and delightfully entertaining ... If the movie has a downside, it's that its great music from the 1960s sometimes outshines the narrative.",1
32056, The film's producers should give audiences a sew-on badge for surviving this.,0
57057," For all the meaningful, emotional depth it tries to delve into, it can't shake the uninvolved, detached feeling that plagues the film throughout its entire runtime.",0

25066," Drugs, sex, language in '90s drama about child abuse. ",0
22965, It's the struggle between the filmmaker's natural instincts and his better self that makes the results so wildly inconsistent.,1
5223," The Hateful Eight is a movie about the worst aspects of human nature, which is why the film can't be quite described as ""fun,"" at least in the traditional sense. But Tarantino isn't glorifying the ugliness; he's condemning it. ",1

53622," Starts out as a sort of bro-com, but soon creeps over to the dark side, where some fine performances and an array of implausibilities await.",1
56159," Where the TV show's Robert Vaughn and David McCallum enjoyed an effortlessly bickering, bantering rapport, Cavill and Armie Hammer's Kuryakin look as if they've just been crated to the set by FedEx and have never met before.",0
65724, The film is beautiful to behold but lacking in any kind of palpable dread or suspense.,0
41680," Bringing a little dash of class to a big brash world, A Little Chaos goes a long way.",1

23213," Simmering with controlled bitterness, Jesus has an intensity and rawness that more than make up for its flaws.",1
79771," Few things are as intolerable as schlock that takes itself seriously. Diary of the Dead, the latest zombie epic from George Romero, falls into that trap.",0
52889, An adequate if unexceptional film noir throwback becomes something altogether less tolerable in its brutal depictions of ... violence against women.,0

73144," ""The Little Hours"" never really commits to being one thing or another. There aren't any written jokes, but it treats its own genre as a punchline. Ultimately, you're just left wondering what it is, and what the point of it all might be.",0
11337," A second-tier ""Untouchables"" interested only in making a lot of noise while ignoring character and plot. The newspaper articles that inspired it tell a much better story.",0

60084," John Dies at the End is joyously heterodox in its method, an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink m√©lange of sci-fi, black comedy, and action, with disquieting body-horror sight gags that at times recall David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch.",1

4613, A feast to the eye but not much for the intellect.,0
18391," It's a very conventional, Bible-bashing approach to religion and spirituality, with dialogue that feels simplistic and preachy. Plot holes abound, as does an OTT soundtrack. It does have a heart, though, in part thanks to Washington.",1

32670, This peculiar and impenetrable look at five boys raised on a secluded farm can be a frustrating endurance test. You'll be rewarded by darkly comic wit and a political allegory that will have you mulling over striking images long after it's over.,1

71692," As he did with Virgin, Apatow here pulls off the not inconsiderable feat of making the crude seem somehow endearing. There's something in the Apatow style that makes palatable material that in the hands of other directors would be tasteless.",1
38680," A wan comedy aimed squarely at whoever it is who buys all those ""Austen-inspired"" books cluttering up the publishing world.",0
30156, It is obvious early on that Cheadle is giving us a combination shaggy dog adventure yarn and a marvelous portrait (not story) of the man and his music.,1

44011," Rather than just another one-dimensional they-made-me-a-vigilante movie, this is, um, just another two-dimensional trudge of solemnity, delicately extracted from only the best stock of irritatingly respectable literary fiction.",1
6010," A lot of energetic, laugh-out-loud fun, with enough there to keep the adults in the room entertained.",1
61701, More fun than a fifth of Rebel Yell and a bag of Quaaludes.,1

79379, One day we'll see a film that really harnesses Atkinson's mighty talent. This isn't it.,0
5266," Makes due on expectations, but also attempts to show off a dramatic side and while that effort isn't a failure, the comedy is so successful, it tarnishes this dramatic material.",1
24018, It's not my favourite Pixar film.,0
22914, The film plays its social satire broad but strings it along a rail of self-awareness.,1
47623, Devastating in its vision of political strife concentrated down to its fundamental human core.,1
30035," The goal of the movie is truth-telling rather than flag-waving, but it also succeeds as impactful storytelling.",1
45782," Nonfiction filmmaking at its finest, using incredible archival footage and fresh interviews to bring new light on an important, overlooked part of recent history.",1
44841, Robin Campillo's vision transcends the mere recount of facts. It immerses the viewer inside the movement and dilutes the division between the personal and the political. [Full Review in Spanish],1

78382," At a little over an hour, it's a slight but visually charming adventure.",1

45910," Grueling as it is to watch, and it's the most protracted ninety-minute movie I've ever seen, it is packed with sly insights into Bush's ""long war,"" hitherto known as the global war on terror.",1
36429," A blast of pure cinema, an intense, intimate drama ... that vividly captures a range of exhilarating emotions from elation to despair. ",1
42910, The film's key dramatic scene lacked the impact it might have had with a better build-up. ,0

61426, The appeal of this pitch is the juxtaposition of Sam's strict religious upbringing and the criminal underworld. Eisenberg delivers on this promise.,1
69197, An oddly beautiful and richly symbolic portrait of a prankster reckoning with his own misdeeds and finding out too late that he's the punchline.,1
34767," It's all about technique, and if you like the technique he's using, you'll like the film.",1
38352," What pulls it all together is what pulls together everything Dolly Parton touches: heartfelt emotion, un-ironic portrayals of modest sincerity (Nettles and Schroder are particularly effective), and a gift for turning treacle into musical gold.",1

42159, No amount of candy and flowers will minimize the damage this feckless film will do to romantic intentions.,0
41422," This awkward, passionless drama conveys neither the sensuality nor the drawn-out sense of longing required by its period tale of a young secretary who falls in love with his employer's wife.",0
41671," They don't make period romps like they used to, but The Three Musketeers comes close; all it needs is a bit more sex",1

12038," The heart of T2 lies in the relationship between Renton and Sick Boy, but their rocky reunion is another victim both to the wheel-spinning innate in Hodge's script and Boyle's relative lack of fresh ideas. ",0
75435," Allen is, by all appearances, still filming first drafts, full of placeholder scenes and dialogue in sore need of polish, and releasing first cuts, full of narrative dead-ends and scenes that don't work.",0
47992," A long, kinetic, yet dreary mess.",0

81143," The film goes far on its good nature, though it is never more than gently funny.",1
32404," While its aspirations are high and its intentions are genuine, the film is a slick and hollow war drama that benefits from some harrowing battle sequences.",0

4143," Its rainy murk is as oppressive as its non-stop brutality, which is monotonously undifferentiated.",0
46286," It's back to threats, stress, and Jesus, with this latest film a slapdash, tedious reworking of old business...These movies should come with a seat belt. A pair of earplugs and sunglasses would be nice to have too.",0
20725," Once doesn't plop its emotions on its characters' sleeves, and it trusts us enough to leave some of the best stuff unstated. In other words, it trusts us to know that half the music lies between the notes.",1
38155," The film is far from perfect, but it's certainly ambitious, often entertaining and, compared to the feeble competition from new American films of the moment, a singing, dancing, stomping and chomping ""Citizen Kane.""",1
54513," Ross stirs up some fascinating discussions in this indie drama... This, St√©phane Fontaine's shimmering cinematography and a generally tight cast are to be commended. What ruins Captain Fantastic are its less than authentic dabbles with comedy.",1

7029," The surprising thing about this above-average relationship movie is its sense of humour, something you wouldn't necessarily expect from a drama that starts with attempted suicide. ",1
34267," At its best, it affects us like adrenaline mixed with laughing gas. But when Baby Driver, like the Energizer bunny, keeps going and going and going (as with half of Wright's other films, it's 20 minutes too long), it manages to run on fumes.",0
62777," Proof is a stirring motion picture that challenges our views on a great many things about life, some of which we take for granted.",1

14790, A look at the sprawling and incredibly powerful Camorra crime family in Italy shows mostly the lurid details of conventional crime. The value of the film lies in exposing crime that is not business as usual.,1

21587, I half expected Holly Hunter to turn up in a bonnet and throw herself speechlessly into the raging sea.,0
39343," Review Aside from further vilifying the Nazis, the film's ideological endgame remains a bit too slippery. ",0
54828," Note to Hollywood: Just because films like ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"" were successful doesn't mean that having characters yell ""Vagina"" every few minutes is funny. It usually isn't. ",1
52717, The key to the movie is how Nugent handles the song Sailboat creates for his grandmother. We never hear him play it or sing it; the screen grows silent when he performs. All we see are the reactions of those who hear the music and his voice.,1
78196, The twistiest thriller since Memento.,1

14010, Schrader pulls no spiritual punches.,1
35266," A huge improvement over the first one, and not just because it has things the 2009 hit didn't bother with - such as a memorable villain, a decent plot and an ending that doesn't seem made up as it goes along. ",1
62706," The most interesting aspects of this auto-biographical work in filmmaking terms is the storytelling style that Ari Folman has chosen, which enables him to show things like his dog nightmares as well as atrocities and violence in a way live action can not",1

11265," It is comforting to know that, in his tireless commitment to doing Chekhov and Ibsen on the London stage, Fiennes hasn't forgotten how to be a movie star.",1
52541," ...a fairly disastrous misfire that simply doesn't work in any way, shape, or form (and this is to say nothing of McAdams' consistently distracting accent). ",0
70695, Pee-pee humor abounds in The Change-Up. There's also a lot of poo-poo humor. And ta-ta humor.,0
11189," If, like me, you like OutKast just fine but staggered out of Moulin Rouge reeling from the quick-cut-induced nausea, you'll leave Idlewild tapping your toe and scratching your head at the same time.",0
5547," After a frenetic and funny first half, 'Hancock' falls apart, devolving into a sentimentalized and scattershot piece short on integrity and sense.",0
64133," Surprisingly enough, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel works. More than that: It's a sweet film about age-old crises that never feel old.",1
56101," ""The Mechanic,"" 2011 edition, is a striking-looking work, combining an arty inkiness with a retro-graininess that more or less screams 1970s, albeit without the cliches and flatness. If only you liked the people in the picture.",0
62367," It's a lavish, handsomely staged production, but it's also dramatically inert, a pretty diorama led by a pair of good-looking but forgettable TV actors.",0
23947," Thanks to director Alfonso Cuaron, a dazzling storyteller with a keen eye for whimsical detail, the third film in the Potter franchise is a visual delight.",1
17240," She is charming and funny, and her blithe, carefree spirit actually comes across as a legitimate way of dealing with life -- or, at the very least, as being better than some of the alternatives.",1
10243," Conceptually brilliant with mind-blowing special effects, but who is the intended audience of this visual extravaganza? Certainly not children: the content is far too dark with haunting imagery that could provoke nightmares for impressionable youngsters",1

26911," The stylishly crafted film mostly succeeds in its engaging (and tagline-ready) ambition to chronicle ""how mankind discovered man's best friend,"" even if its naturalistic strengths are swapped out for an exaggeratedly epic tone in the later going.",1
27271, ... I loved about 49 percent of this movie but I hated 51 percent of it so I'm going to give this film thumbs down.,0
46594," Without the true-story conceit, The Fourth Kind would be just another formula horror flick with a couple of passable jolts trying to hold a flimsy story together.",0
26096, Director Mike Flanagan turns the fragile nature of consciousness into a better fear tactic than any visceral shocks could possibly achieve. ,1
82308, The most Lynchian of all his films. It may also be the most maddening -- or the most brilliant. Or possibly both.,1
72205," Rather than deal with the complications of romantic bliss, though, the makers of this sequel have decided to ignore the question entirely and basically remake the original movie.",0

3214," It doesn't add up to much, but it's an entertaining journey.",1
10085, Unless De Palma's trying to be ironic--and we're quite sure he's not--a fictionalized story likely isn't the best way to show how real-life truths are concealed from the public.,0
22358," I was incredibly moved by this film, the way it delves into emotional investment, the power of literature to humanise, the whole ambition to encompass the responsibility of a nation for the evil that occurred.",1
74969," Russell Crowe's command as a debut director may not be as strong as Clooney's was, but The Water Diviner is a very sincere, inspired-by-true-events effort filled with compassionate performances.",1
75187, Wes Anderson's darkest movie yet retains his whimsical sense of humour and Fantastic Mr Fox-styled absurdity. ,1

75976," What the film lacks in clean-cut storytelling, though, it more than makes up for in sheer emotionality. Finding Dory is the rare sequel that repurposes the original as a foundation rather than as a cheap form of fan service.",1

76963," All but the most dedicated fans of the director's work might find this story a little too diffuse and meandering, its rewards too deeply buried beneath the evasive wordiness.",0
61581, The film predictably alternates in scaring its characters by tapping into their deepest fears and having them rub shoulders with the relics of a past that insists on being undisturbed. ,0
57617," brings together the numerous narrative and thematic threads that make such stories, even when being told for the umpteen-millionth time, really work",1

14442," A great cast and an impressive scale, but it ultimately falls apart almost completely",0

47172," Too much of the action in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit takes place on laptops, thumb drives, and video monitors.",0
21968," The film, while being sold as a hit-man drama, is really just a series of vignettes, with Bankol√©'s blank slate character encountering various people in Spain.",0
44981," To elder audiences who can empathize, this likely final starring feature for film legend Jerry Lewis will resonate strongly, uncomfortably and ultimately life-affirmingly.",1
32993," Completely forgettable, ""Hellions"" is far less cool, smart, and scary than it thinks it is. ",0

80216," Taking seven years to complete, this labour of love makes for a rewarding experience for viewer, for it's an indelible visual experience.",1
75299," The stellar supporting cast helps compensate, and Phil Parmet's muddy photography is a constant visual reminder of the everyday desolation that helped drag Jim into his black hole of despair.",1
60729, Depressingly mediocre. Even the gags that worked in the red-band trailer fall flat.,0
19020, The on-screen chemistry between father and son is a winning formula - lifting the film from just another tear-jerker into a heartfelt and compelling slice of cinema.,1
53732, the movie is an intense comedy about psychological abuse that will repulse as many viewers as it pleases. The only reaction it will likely not instill is nonchalance.,0
40592," ""Sin Nombre"" is a convincing verite-styled drama that pulls you into its dangerous universe of desperation and immediacy.",1
68555," There's some overlap between Raimi's irreverent sensibility and the large-scale fractured fairytale his Hollywood betters seem to want, but there's tension, too, and the persistent clank of an overly tinkered machine.",0
46027," (The movie is) set in 1991, in a small town where high school culture is a John Hughes movie, with all the confusion, '80s music and hip ennui that implies. ",1
63509, The eye-rolling twists and formulaic storytelling compromise any suspense in this uninspired cautionary tale.,0
44314," Deeply emotive performances by Ally and Rockman plus a strong turn by Sandi Schultz as the dead cop's partner, further elevate this tough, vivid film.",1
38326," A jittery, unapologetic experience worth a look for those who prefer psychological horror over broad slasher cliches.",1

18022," ""Film, Mrs Cole, real life with the boring bits cut out"" says scriptwriter Tom Buckley. A witty story about authenticity in an age of propaganda, this is a captivating, fascinating and sometimes abrasive tale about women and men fighting their own wars. ",1
61746," The Crazies is 101 minutes long and about 87 minutes of that is crap. The characters are lifeless, the scares are predictable and the allusions to the Iraq War are even more fucking mad than you'd expect.",0
2493," Their voice work, combined with some amusingly expressive animation, and of course, Dahl's peerless writing, means that aside from being just the longest of the nominees, Revolting Rhymes is also one of the very best.",1

59924, Promised Land is high-minded material - but makes for a flaccid viewing experience.,0
16280," With an obvious love for British gardens and heritage-protected interiors, first-time director Dustin Hoffman...delivers a congenial, easy-to-like comedy-drama.",1
12800," [Madinson] Wolfe is a talent, simultaneously tough and tender in her performance.",1
77920," ""Julieta"" may not be top-tier Almodovar, but a collaboration between him and Munro, two artists who have spent their lives going deep into the interior lives of women, shouldn't be overlooked.",1
62504," With its rushed pace and isn't-this-wacky soundtrack, the film exudes TV shallowness, and by the time it arrives at its absurdly happy ending, it has all the impact of a pinch.",0
65478, It's hard to imagine anyone not being utterly enthralled by the timeless charms and dazzling animation prowess of The Incredibles.,1
69196," High Flying Bird is an unshapely piece of storytelling - there are gaps in the plot, and it never locks into a rhythm - but [its] mournfulness and resentment seep into you.",1
52851," While the film is largely entertaining, I wish the director had not bowed down to the pressure of turning Gulaab Gang into a typical Bollywood masala film.",1
47735," Told mostly in flashback, this story perfectly illustrates Carn√©'s mastery of poetic realism and Jacques Pr√©vert's appreciation of the lyricism of everyday speech.",1
71191, It's hypnotic work with a terrific sense of cultural study and geography.,1
43228," A sly, subversive stand in favour of empathy.",1
2499," Breathtakingly beautiful, truly magical movie.",1
61961," A freak show of bodily trauma, with a great gooey gob of pedophilia slapped on the end of this feature, which requires another visit to the multiplex in a year's time to complete. I'll make sure to update my shots beforehand. ",0
67927, Movie intimacy reaches groundbreaking new heights in this shocking story of a young marriage on the rocks.,1
25546," 4 Days in France not only maps national consensus, but as it explores different characters (from a lonely, risky 20-year-old to a middle-aged veteran libertine), it also charts an alternative history of French philosophy.",1
70488," With the critical narrative information delayed until the film's final moments, it's a waiting game for the audience, not unpleasurably spent watching the gorgeous costumes and eccentric behaviour of the family and friends of an anxious bride.",1
7431," Simply as a wallow in black-and-white Gallic romanticism, it's a treat, but Tavernier also provides good stuff in his commentary.",1
61749," Ron Howard leads the film dispassionately and unimaginatively, with too much faith in the merits of the talky script, although Ransom almost has a subject for a moment, flashing a little class conflict just like actresses used to flash a little stocking.",0
14729, Bravo and roll out the Oscar nominations.,1
57578," It's the epitome of a summer blockbuster. The explosive action is practically nonstop, breaking only occasionally for jokes and a touch of romance - though without ever breaking its grim, apocalyptic tone.",1
52416," After the invigorating cinematic brio of 2005's Pride And Prejudice, it's disheartening to see the Austen brand retreat back into Costume Drama 101...",0
78874," Best described as Home Alone meets Michael Haneke's Funny Games, the sadistic horror comedy Safe Neighborhood is the kind of film that's tough to categorize but easy to enjoy.",1
50143," Broken Embraces is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside a slightly overindulgent parade of gushing film references.",1
6790," Dedicating this film to Don Adams is like killing seeing-eye dogs as tribute to the American Council of the Blind. Lest insults not be spread to the deaf, it's cruel irony that Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" is an integral part of a dreary, dismal and soulless",0
29412," Ultimately, her movie is about how her life, anybody's life, is created out of oddments that never quite cohere, and don't need to. The sheer sensuousness of all these bric-a-brac memories is sustaining.",1
38305," Swank's purity of essence is nicely paired with Rockwell, who is more arch and complicated and would look guilty doing mission work in Mumbai. It's a special quality Rockwell has.",1
62478, Comes with an inherent disclaimer that nobody but 11-year-old girls are going to dig it.,0
51231," Conventional movies, even independent ones, tend to get histrionic and judgmental about such drug-related setbacks. But Granik's film, though hardly a clinical case study, keeps a measured distance from the heavy-handed or simplistic.",1
60556," This recklessly constructed mix of social messages, sexual fantasies and street profanity certainly won't be accused of trying to preach to the choir.",0
67755," Daniels is not a subtle director, and he encourages Mo'Nique's powerful expansiveness. But it's much harder to act quietly than loudly, as Sidibe must do, and her still grace should not be mistaken for blankness.",1
62216," This Disney live-action adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894) is upbeat, tasteful and well-crafted.",1
38739," There is no joy in Hulkville. And intellectually, I know that is how it should be.",1
69660," ""On Chesil Beach"" is both a lovely story and a heartbreaking one. Ronan and Howle bring such strength and depth to their performances that you can't help rooting for them.",1
49295," The movie never makes your choices difficult or challenges your role as a consumer, indicting consumers of violence in a way that's simultaneously obvious and pleasurable, and not at all your problem.",0
20035, [Let the Sunshine In] is an elegant choreography of hesitant dialogues loaded with truth. [Full Review in Spanish] ,1
39360," Like all the best comics movies, this one's got a villain (Michael B. Jordan) so compelling he nearly steals the show from the hero (Chadwick Boseman).",1
51361," As far as bad movies go, Righteous Kill is something of a zenith.",0
39607," It's all handled with an appropriately lighthearted tone, so raise a glass and enjoy.",1
24523," Mr. Dujardin, a skilled comedian, deftly embodies the spy's combination of cluelessness and condescension, but it's an act that eventually wears thin.",0
52543, A very enjoyable and entertaining movie even though it doesn't go further than that but I'm sure you'll have a great time seeing it. [Full review in Spanish],1
17244," Well acted, and occasionally droll, this is an abstract piece of work that doesn't quite excavate enough character interest to compensate for the lack of narrative.",0
49352," This one-trick, entirely derivative exercise in old-school slasher tropes doesn't stretch very far.",0
25159," Samberg can't carry this, though director Akiva Schaffer supplies some hilarious, Jackass-style wipeouts.",0
32112, I can't deny the merits of My King. But I stand by my assessment of this kind of movie. It's difficult to watch for all its meanness and destructive histrionics.,1
2009," As much as 3D detracted from, say, Man of Steel, so does it enhance How to Train Your Dragon 2. Call it How to Train Your Cranky Elders That 3D is Good Sometimes.",1
54701," That revenge is sweet is no new moral code for Hollywood, of course, but in this case it's asking quite a bit to suggest that we cheer murderers and drug dealers.",0
720, A fun movie that could have been brilliant if it had been just a bit more bonkers.,1
45025, A powerhouse performance full of tragic comic undertones while looking at the psychological effects of war in an original storytelling manner...,1
66987," The film is OK, it's the name that's all wrong.",1
40339," If the best comedies make you laugh and the worst make you angry, this is the middling and well-intentioned brand that makes you frustrated -- keenly looking for reasons to laugh but, more often than not, failing to find any.",0
53475," Rest assured the ending here is very 21st century: cheap, predictable, and witless. ",0
30195," A staggeringly unfunny comedy, the film mines homophobia, accidental decapitation and the objectification of women for lols.",0
47747," [Law and Kidman are] not onscreen together much, but that means their few moments should be all the more urgent, and they aren't.",1
50441," Has a potent message about how the drive to fight crime can lead to questionable tactics and miscarriages of justice, but it rather stacks the deck in delivering it. ",1
80294," you won't know whether to laugh, cry, or moon the screen. Von Trier shoots, von Trier scores.",1
30597, ...a fable that relies less on fantastical transport than the defrosting of cool faculties; less on the titillation of the senses than the thawing of frozen hearts.,1
58210," Tobey Maguire is one of our best young actors, and he couldn't be more appealing here.",1
39616, A tribute to the power of friendship to help pull us through crises and problems which are often too hard to handle ourselves. ,1
949," Its colorful style recalls the flamboyant amorality of GoodFellas and Blow, and it's often funnier and more succinct than either.",1
83575," 'Superfly' stylishly and violently looks, feels and plays enough like the Gordon Parks Jr. original to make it a slight guilty pleasure.",1

43836, A well told spooky story with very good performances. [Full Review in Spanish],1
64474," I'm glad, I seriously am, that John Carney wants to make deeply and embarrassingly sincere musical movies, and I hope he keeps on making them, but let's also hope he realizes that when it comes to Once, once was enough.",0
66597," The film will appeal to those who love such British underdog stories as The Full Monty, Brassed Off and Billy Elliot.",1
5345," As good as the lead actor is, he's not enough to save this picture from landing on the scrap-heap of uninspired, derivative, and grotesquely distasteful character studies.",0
83312," Hawkins does all right by her role as written, but I kept imagining what she might have done if she wasn't required to be so unremittingly valorous.",1
70996," Given the focus is on battle sequences as opposed to character development, the 144 minute running time feels unnecessary. Fans of Michael Bay may think otherwise.",0

19534, Wirkola finds room for at least one good sight gag (a zombie commandant becomes frustrated when he is unable to return a 'Sieg heil!' salute due to his chopped-off right arm) before he succumbs to the hee-haw bloodbath of the battle royale finale.,0
77117," Cooper's western may be too meditative for some, but its grit, beauty and honesty are too potent to ignore.",1
28467, What passes for comedy here doesn't have a chance against a thesis so scary and sad.,0
20949," The brilliant mix of ideas, the audacity and originality of approach, the sensualist delight in the ravishing play of light and shadow -- all these remain, as bracing and inspirational as ever.",1
48090," Artistically, the film is the waste product of income inequality, masquerading as commentary. Its desire to make the 1970s look like vomit is relentless.",0
38454, It is a goofy and amusing late summer film with more than enough laughs to recommend it.,1
2783, Americans have a propensity for getting chummy with heroic figures of the past -- a tendency on display in this lightly amusing history lesson.,1
77845," The movie traffics in clich√©, and will make you resent the following: New York City, dinner parties, cocktail parties, gallery openings, museums, used bookstores, writers, taxicabs, white people, apartments, rain, the entirety of the English language.",0
81134, I'd have opened a vein if it had only stopped the interminable The Forgiveness of Blood.,0

66245, Extremely relaxed and unfailingly entertaining...,1
83297, There's something about seeing this strong female character push her capabilities that's genuinely thrilling and empowering. We finally have a worthy cinematic avatar!,1
66973," There are clearly some fascinating ideas embedded in [The Sound of Silence], but the whole production is too numbingly flat.",0
74916," This is a wobbly comedy rooted too deeply in three- or four-minute TV-style set pieces, which misfire more often than not.",0
79545, The exceedingly low-rent production values subsequently ensure that the more overtly horrific elements within Craven's script often fall completely flat...,0
36952," While the plot and some of the characters may be a bit cartoonish, the emotions always feel honest and Waititi is able to get some big laughs thanks to his charming protagonists.",1
79522," A smart, super raunchy comedy with cast chemistry that's through the roof. Kay Cannon makes her feature directorial debut with a film that boasts a winning ratio of laughs and heart.",1
47237, Blackhat may be so lovingly and artistically crafted that it fools some viewers into judging it as an art film.,1
59248," We Are What We Are doesn't waste time with cheap scares. Mickle keeps his story on a steady, slow simmer, transporting us minute by minute into the very heart of dread.",1
21475," With a little tweaking, this could be a horror film.",0
14137, As derivative as the first movie.,0
27998, The kind of confident debut that radiates personality and visual flair while retaining a quietly fluttering heart.,1
21406," It's gruelling at times, but the film is extraordinary and unflinching. And remarkably, it's made with as much love as anger.",1
28435," Oh boy, this is a howler, justly ranked as one of the worst films in history and shocking in that it didn't kill Carpenter's career outright.",0
77786," This may well be the first prehistoric epic in which the liberal deployment of such words as ""oog,"" ""agh"" and ""uck"" would have actually improved the screenplay considerably.",0
62864," With this cast, as well as director David Gordon Green on board, you expect a lot more than the occasional chuckle.",0
27031, 'Plodding' is definitely the operative word this time around.,0
47050," might also be called In the Shadow of Neil Armstrong because the absence of his towering presence in the film is a big, gaping hole in the narrative",0
33600, Jennifer Lawrence is dazzling as the film's protagonist as she struggles to uncover the truth between her addict father's disappearance.,1
1994, It's strange to see Cage here ... parading around in action sequences that feels so detached from the franchise's roots.,0
47590," If you enjoy sitting slumped in a theater while an ambitious filmmaker attempts to bore you to death, you shouldn't miss this stultifying feature debut from writer-director Eduardo Williams.",0
49658, [An uneven but] not so predictable story about coming to terms with who you and the people close to you are.,0
57556," Assorted conflicts and adventures ensue, and the movie overall is painless if not exactly electrifying.",0
74415, A wonderful film -- both funny and affecting.,1
21706, Everybody Wants Some!! is the rare sort of raunchy American comedy that allows as much time for scenes of people simply talking as it does for mud-wrestling matches and bar brawls,1
56566, I'm not inclined to dismiss Kechiche's desire to speak to everyone or write it off as mere appropriation... I suspect he found parallels between Maroh's experience as a lesbian and his own experience as an Arab in France.,1
2279, Even hostile invasions need a bit more character and plot development.,0
61205, Men and women find a way to communicate without speaking in this prison movie which is probably an original for the genre.,1
73520, Sometimes a feast of acting isn't enough.,0

14682," ... India has found its cute-couple movie with appeal to the Hollywood-leaning crowd, a secret that film-makers in Singapore have yet to crack.",1
7720," More well-meaning than your everyday multiplex paycheck grab, but in other ways not much less cynical.",0
77807, One more vehicle in which filmmakers rely on the improvisational skills of their cast to fill out a one-note idea.,0
22657," Unusual for a rom-com these days, it actually manages to be both romantic and comedic.",1
10212, A disappointing follow-up to 'Catching Fire.' You're left feeling as if you've only watched half a movie without the same feeling of anticipation to see what happens next.,0
15359, What you'd expect from the writers of the Hangover movies,0
4912," It's astonishing to watch a dying man plead for the sanctity of his spiritual life. All of his embarrassing bodily functions are on display, but nothing feels more intimate than having dominion over your own soul.",1
36780," Over the course of the film, Mbatha-Raw does many things, all of them quite well.",1
78736," The film gets to where it's going by the midpoint and then just sits there, grinding your face in its (or Swede's? or Roth's?) hatred of the 1960s.",0
66082," Bland and predictable, but who cares? For the incurable Gallic romantic in all of us.",1
77411, What's the worst thing you can say about a superhero movie? It's dull. The Fantastic Four is deadly dull. ,0
68935, It's like watching a movie in another language. ,0
14522, This is a blandly forgettable affair only the youngest members of the audience are likely to find captivating.,0
39399," My reaction to The Holiday was no different from my reaction to Meyers' other pieces. It's cute enough, the atmosphere is sufficiently romantic comedy-like, but somehow, for some reason, I just don't bond with it.",1
60882," Jonze has crafted something extremely rare in this era: a love story almost entirely free of cynicism, in a movie bereft of self-referential nonsense.",1
25291, The term 'gentle' is too harsh a word to describe the pace of this tale which is so slow in places it's a wonder moss isn't growing on it.,0
51067," At its best, ""Valerian"" has the dense, madcap rush of a comedic cartoon sci-fi - think ""Futurama"" or ""Rick and Morty,"" though neither as funny nor as inventive as either.",1
64871," ""Adult World"" proceeds by fits and starts, but fans of Cusack won't want to miss his performance as the petulant poet, whose resistance is inevitably worn down by his persistent fan.",1
41097, Half Nelson drags the crowd-pleasing white-teacher-inspires-black-students movie onto the mat and pins the flabby genre in the first round.,1
34990," This Sherlock Holmes refuses to take himself seriously. Brilliant, because it allows to RDJ and Ritchie to let rip with their non-traditionalist revamp. Not so great because super-sleuthing loses out to bone-crunching. Either way, the brio is infectious.",1
12551, It is its own cinematic zooniverse.,1
11588, It really felt like 2 episodes of the animated series crammed together with nothing particularly cinematic to set the animation apart.,0
4249," Playful and delightful, it's a wonderfully and breezily entertaining film.",1

23859," Safe House will never be over, we think, as we watch Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds rush around Johannesburg and points east, west, north, south.",0
14463, Not even the great Michel Piccoli can save a film with little bite but too much forced humor,0
25225," Despite Hopkins' balmy performance, this scare picture is too serious by half. In place of supernatural hocus-pocus we get artsy-fartsy set design, hoof prints in the snow.",0
81631," The promise is to scare you out of your wits. Does it work? For me: no. To tell you the truth, I was bored, frustrated and nauseous from the terminally jerky hand-held camera",0
53868," Anaconda, directed by Luis Llosa with all of the subtlety of a snake-oil salesman, is in the great tradition of cinematic cheese, as processed as Kraft Singles slices.",1
55838," Hitchcock, of course, got lots of mileage out of just such absurd plots. But Wes Craven, whatever other strengths he has, isn't Hitchcock.",0
75744," I can't think of a family I'd rather sit shiva with than the Altmans of ""This Is Where I Leave You.""",1
74884," It's a delirious ride, full of fun and darkly comic moments, and its just the spike Neeson needs as his badass persona had seemingly run its course.",1

15520, The ethics of big business and concept of men out of work haunt every frame of the morally in tune recession drama The Company Men.,1
24670," While he takes a somewhat circuitous route to get there, Bujalski winds up with a fairly charming portrait of people stuck in ruts of isolation, without the people skills to get out of them.",1
44207," One of the worst, most disheartening times I have had in a movie theater. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Nudity, Violence, Profanity, etc. - Also Available)",0
9945," Love may have been in the air onscreen, but I certainly wasn't feeling any of it.",0

58380, Kemp engages the eye with a variety of camera tricks and animated inventions that belie his modest budget.,1
65118, There's nothing here to match the visceral shock in Alien of seeing John Hurt's chest explode but Scott does deliver a grisly standout scene that exploits the series' recurring themes of body horror and fear of birth,1
70165," A companion piece to Tenenbaums more than a step in new directions, Darjeeling is a movie about people trapped in themselves and what it takes to get free...",1
80232," Astute -- even frisky -- as it is, Notorious Bettie Page never shakes being enamored of the mystery of Page.",1
55237," Jane Got a Gun is a serviceable, by-the-numbers western. I'm glad it survived the many obstacles of its production, but I'm not sure why the cast and crew fought so hard to save this rather safe, conventional movie.",1
41636," Skyfall stands out by bringing Bond into a real world milieu. For many reasons, things aren't so comfortable and secure anymore.",1
32841," It's everything one should expect from a new 'Dragon Ball' movie. If I don't praise it any more, it's because it's not particularly revolutionary. [Full review in Spanish]",1
80826, ...an amiable (if rather forgettable) bit of family-friendly entertainment.,1
78742," The first Hemingway novel made into a Hollywood film is also one of the better ones due to Gary Cooper's star turn and Borzage's stylized helming, even if a happy ending was imposed against the author's wishes and protests.",1
59032," The film's broad smiles and big-heartedness are bracingly disingenuous, the self-referential jokes well handled. Only the affection emanating from the audience is sincere.",0
66747," Far from being a historical cautionary tale, ""Command and Control"" looks forward, not backward. Kenner's unsettling film casts its worried gaze not at the accidents that already have taken place, but at the ones yet to happen.",1
15506," More false than Ms. Hilton's ""accidental"" panty-flashings, Noam Murro's dull, meandering dramedy reduces love to a montage and mourning to Quaid's inability to ride shotgun",0
63467," So loaded with information, the ""fog of war"" morphs into a more enveloping fog of politics and ethics.",1
79584," Unfortunately, its screenplay doesn't hold up to the beautiful production design and the gorgeous cinematography. [Full review in Portuguese.]",0

59984, The movie becomes a bit too campy,0
17434," Tatum is once again the main attraction, back with his Oscar-worthy dry hump (his acting's not bad either).",1
32106," [A] meandering, unfocused movie that tries to force more material out of a gimmick -- without actually using the gimmick -- than is possible.",0
9985, This film is one of my favourite mainstream releases this year.,1
50223, A comic director finds her voice,1
56686," This lyrical study of love and death may not be everyone's cup of tea, but Gus Van Sant's superb control of and sensitivity to the material make it one of his very best, and one of those rare fiction films which can truly be described as inspiring.",1

60307," A third-rate effort, with a weak script, cheap-looking effects and no genuine frights.",0
62308," The real problem with the movie is simple - it's just not funny enough, and too worried about making McCarthy's usual hilarious supporting character into a woman sympathetic enough (that is, bland enough) to be the heroine.",0
83238," Two Days, One Night is a small miracle of a movie, a drama so purely humane that it makes most attempts at audience uplift look crass and calculated by comparison.",1
16331, The picture is so superbly executed in every other respect that Casey seems more quirky than miscast.,1
65302, Director-cowriter Sachs takes an unusually intimate look at a 10-year relationship in this beautifully shot and performed New York drama. ,1
35876," Inspiration strikes when Spider-Man returns to full-tilt, but with a better balance of spectacle and sentiment, it could have been a four-star, fist-pumping triumph. ",1
83502, A thriller that works under its own standard and never tries to be more than it is. Michelle Williams is impressive. [Full review in Spanish].,1
70403," It's not Pixar's most innovative or clever movie by any means, but it ultimately delivers in terms of offering something to entertain everyone.",1
62289," Beyond the impeccable performances and direction, it's foremost an exceptional piece of screenwriting, so finely wrought that the drama seems guided by an invisible hand.",1
54497," While wildly creative and refreshingly subversive, I can't really say that Swiss Army Man as a whole works, or even if I liked it.",0
10216," Not as good as the first Iron Man, not as bad as Green Lantern, it's almost a necessary, even obligatory panel toward next year's Avengers, but as a stand-alone adventure, it leaves much to be desired. ",1

15255, It's like the story of Father Abraham if it were crazy and incoherant.,0
49946," Alas, as directed by the returning David Yates, these big chase sequences are the usual compendium of ear-splitting noise and eye-glazing edits -- again, no magic required and none delivered.",0

15644," 10 Cloverfield Lane was a delightful ride, full of amusing scary bits and actors who are interesting to watch. Ultimately the biggest problem with 10 Cloverfield Lane was its sham of a marketing campaign. ",1
59157," What keeps Daddy's Home watchable is Wahlberg's checkmate machismo, as the intimidating foil necessary for Ferrell's namby-pambyism to register. It's like watching Andy Samberg's SNL impersonation of tough guy Mark Wahlberg, a self-parody of a spoof.",0
58488, A striking new female character is ready for action in a fantastic-looking movie. Cameron and Rodriguez were the right team to bring this story to life in such a kinetically entertaining fashion,1

11212, Saturday Night Fever is wonderfully honest and completely accurate when it comes to depicting that stagnant environment that keeps young people like Tony pinned down.,1
83032," Just as Friends With Kids compares unfavorably to Westfeldt's earlier effort, her cast members' previous projects further highlight this film's shortcomings.",0
83296," Seems to be constructed strictly as a go-for-broke cinematic thrill ride, a sort of demo for the latest and most spectacular visual effects available from Hollywood. It feels like overkill.",0

81138, One of the very best movies of this beloved and sleazy genre.,1

81917," A dry dream of postmenopausal-male sexual lethargy, this comedy's least musty ideas are among its worst.",0
62093," In many ways, Too Funny To Fail captures a time when television was actually more willing to take those kinds of risks and abuse.",1
27701," While it looks great with its gorgeous computer-generated foliage and realistic animals, the story focuses too much on its stiff hero and a one-note villain rather than the big-picture ideas it raises in passing.",0
25659," A satirical scream of rage against patriarchal prerogatives, this feminist horror-comedy, written and directed by Ms. Palka, has a vicious edge that can stifle your laughter.",1

20950," While it's never a bad movie, it is never a memorable one either. It's one of those comedies that produces no laughs, at least not from me.",0
30469, Less than the sum of its maddeningly redundant parts.,0
82908, What makes this another winner is that there are more than enough subversive chuckles to balance out the sugar. It is almost impossible to not smile through the duration of the movie. ,1
44821, The familiar premise is done with enough intelligence and heartfelt conviction that it rises above its potentially clich√© trappings. ,1

64208," The Square's narrative is meandering and episodic, feeling almost like a feel-bad sketch comedy show than a traditional story.",1
81350, Most knowledgeable filmgoers can figure out who does what to whom and who winds up with whom. The enjoyable part is watching everyone get there.,1

24500," Not quite a dog of a movie, but it's certainly not worth barking about.",0
5787, ... neither a terrible sci-fi'er nor a very good one. It's a capably handled escape with above average CG effects. Adolescent boys looking for a Saturday afternoon time-killer could do worse.,0

22311, A paint-by-numbers supernatural thriller that's more interesting for its locations than for its story.,0
83305," Taking place mostly over the course of a single day, it's a smart and languorous film that finds time to luxuriate in conversations and to create a feeling for small-town American life.",1
41197," Though she wisely foregoes drawing simplistic conclusions from a story brimming with unanswerable questions, Coppola doesn't scratch very far below the surface of this enigmatic fairy tale.",0
30282, It was only a matter of time before a Dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens.,1
53766," Although there is a musical number ... that will make you bust out laughing, the rest of the movie proves to be so poorly constructed that it's almost unbearable.",0
36863," With movies of this sort becoming as prevalent as they are, there has to be more than just expensive looking stunts on display.",0
16596," It's all hokum, but it travels well until it goes through a few more otherworldly tunnels and doors than it should have.",1
55207," Filmmaker Paul W. S. Anderson's misguided molten-driven melodrama Pompeii is not as explosive in conception as one would imagine based upon its manufactured, boisterous presentation.",0
66382, Director Gavin Hood has achieved something few could -- he made what is essentially 100 minutes of people standing in rooms and staring at screens incredibly compelling. It's a master class in suspense.,1
52162," The arthouse Pleasantville, this handsomely crafted facsimile of '50s melodrama is unengaging and redundant, the lacquered artifice erecting a barrier between screen and audience.",0
76695," An artless, facile gaze at an American icon, a film whose look and dialogue often come off like an adaptation of the back of a vintage Wheaties box.",0
22848," Every time the movie threatens to get interesting, one of its hordes of ersatz, non-animated characters shows up and starts talking again.",0
55608," District 9 is a cautionary tale about man's inhumanity to aliens, especially those aliens who are high in cholesterol.",1
114, Gunn's soundtrack picks also come as a surprise and work exceptionally well -- there's a scene where Star-Lord and Baby Groot cozy up while listening to Cat Stevens' Father and Son that might find you looking for a hanky underneath your popcorn tub.,1
2868," Holmer directs with supreme confidence, allowing the film to build to a boil at its own measured pace but not in a way that ever feels slow or drawn out. ",1
26873, Quietly powerful and curious film.,1

72662," Overall, there isn't really much to see in Junooniyat that hasn't already been seen and done much better in the past",0
83455," While the story includes illicit romance, war crimes and how contemporary Europeans deal with the guilt of World War II, the movie isn't as engrossing as it should be because it's consistently clinical and glum.",1
67693," Sure, characters spout inspirational lines left and right, but its warm, cozy, and sometimes renegade vibe is utterly contagious.",1
20427, Jolie does as well as she can with the twigs they've given her to make a plot house out of.,0
55169," Like many of the 400-odd movies Roger Corman has produced and/or directed, Corman's World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel has a title that sizzles over content that merely simmers.",0

74416," As the equivalent of a Jason Momoa pinup calendar, Aquaman rates four stars. As a superhero film, this soggy enterprise merits decidedly less.",0
26375," Definitely not funny, and not appropriate for young teenagers! Yuck!",0
70471," Better than the woeful Scream 3, partly thanks to the influx of new faces and the return of Williamson. But really it's more of the same, as the franchise slips further towards total self-parody.",1

618, Genius may have its failings but it glows with a shared wonder of the world and of the written word.,1
10206," I quite enjoyed ""Hyde Park on Hudson"" while I was watching it, but ultimately it feels like a minor picture on purpose, as if it had been deliberately designed to be everybody's second- or third-choice holiday film.",1
67133, Comparisons to the 1976 original are inevitable. Carrie is a first-rate horror movie. Period. And that goes for 1976 and 2013.,1
9430," Even though this may not represent these actors' personal bests, its rousing, uplifting spirit is infectious.",1
69534," Despite its third-act problems, A Tale of Two Sisters easily passes the scare test.",1
33316," This bittersweet, multilingual romantic comedy is just as fluffy and forgettable as its title suggests.",0
76934," Arguably Wes Anderson's most compassionate, mature film, ""Darjeeling"" dances around disconcerting what-ifs: If they weren't your brothers and sisters, would you voluntarily befriend them, or do you tolerate quirks and annoyances because blood links you?",1
15820," While it lacks the sense of surprise of [the last film], its mix of action, humor, effects, the introduction of a new character and the reintroduction of an old one strikes just the right tone for a film that is as much about marketing as moviemaking.",1
712," Instead of inspired Hollywood Shuffle-style parody, we get caricatures of color and glib riffs about economic insolvency in black America.",0
11335," Park Chul-soo directs a film about love, growing up, and a doubtful, to say the least, S. Korean law. However, there is no deep analysis, as the focus is on entertainment, rather than context with the steamy sex scenes take a large part of its duration",0

8797, It does more by doing less: enhancing the pulp origins of Kong's world and focusing on having a good time instead of reminding us how much better its immortal predecessor was.,1
23637, The movie feels uncertain as to its own tones and intentions.,0
42313," The movie's effectiveness boils down to Ms. Keaton. You cheer for her when she laughs. You sympathize with her when she weeps. And when she does both at the same time, you realize how completely human her character is.",1
75670, A superbly acted effort to immortalize Shakespeare's early play on the big screen.,1

78786," It makes you proud to be human, and embarrassed to still use your fingers when attempting maths.",1
14401," Albertine and Gillick are superb for untrained actors in a distinctly naturalist-style drama. Hogg, however, is the real star of the show.",1
